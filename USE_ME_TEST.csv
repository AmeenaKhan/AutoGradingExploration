The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful.

24533,9,1,1,The author first starts off by telling what the problem is. The problem is space junk. The author explains exactly what this 'junk' is. The author then gives a history of space exploration. I think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up.

17418,7,1,1,"One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when Anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants Papa home, thats being self-centered.  Rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family."
24643,9,1,1,"The author begins with an exclamation to grab attention of the reader, he then begins telling the reader about microdebris and that it is becoming a very serious hazard. he then tells the reader about small objects the size of baseballs and smaller being left in space and how much damage they can cause to a well crafted spacecraft getting hit by a baseball sized object, he also gives a sandblaster example, how sand doesnt hurt if they wind blows it but they also use sand to remove paint with a sandblaster, showing the power change for the same object just different speeds."
17292,7,1,1,Rose is a very caring person. She gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family. One example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to Sacramento anyways. She would have to stay home and take care of her family.
8323,4,0,0,"The author is biased in this article he defended reptiles because they were said to be invasive species. "" The author  thinks that invasive is passing judgment"" Invasive is important to the article because the author wanted to show the readers that these kinds of species can not be harmful."

8713,4,1,1,"The word ""invasive"" is important to the rest of the article because it talks about how there's too many of certain species in one area.

The article talks about the dangers of having too many of a single species."
8402,4,1,0,"The word "" Invasive"" is significant to this article because it is the way people classify reptiles. In the article, he states that the U. S. fish and wildlife service is blocking him from importing some reptiles. The word "" invasive"" is used to describe these types of reptiles passing unfair judgement to them."
5861,3,0,0,Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because both can live off of one thing and only in that area. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koala bears.

21646,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul get on Mr. Leonard, motivates him to work harder for learning how to read and to give him something to work for. When Mr. Leonard spoke of the loss of his scholarship and flunking out of school it made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard had helped him. At the end of Paragraph 45 it reads, 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Which shows that Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard learn to read."
18283,7,0,0,She doesnt really car what Aunt Kolab has to say. She just wants to live her life free
17306,7,1,1,I think a trait that Rose has is caring. Rose is caring because she cares about her family and understands what things are going on and tries to help her sister understand. She also is like a leader to her sister.
6042,3,1,2,"They are both similar to each other in that they are both specialists. What that means is they can only eat very particular things and are not accostomed to change.

17197,7,0,0,Rose thinks that money is very important and determines your overall state of wealth and her sister doesn't. In the story as Rose and Anna were talking Anna says 'Money isn't everything Rose' and then Rose replies 'Not if you already have everything.' And to me this is just like saying that Rose wouldn't be happy unless she had everything.
5416,3,1,1,"The China's Panda and Australia's Koala are simillar, because they do not eat meat but they eat want cames out from the general. The are different from pythons, because mostly the python would prefer to eat meat and not leave or bamboo."

6077,3,2,2,"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist animals,which  means that they eat, almost exclusively, one specific type of food and can only live in one area. Whereas, pythons have a much larger diet and con eat almost anything. Therefore, they can live in many areas and are called generalists."
6599,3,1,2,China's pandas are similar to Australia's koala because both of these animals eat plants. In the article it states that the panda bear eats almost nothing but bamboo & the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves most exclusively. This clearly states the difference between these animals & the python because pythons are carnivors they eat meat. In the story it says animals such as rats are becoming extinct because of the python it even tried to eat a crocodile. The 2 different kind of bears can rely on plants instead of meat.

5140,3,2,0,"Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat plants for most of their life. They are also similar because they are both specialist that live in warm areas.

9488,4,1,0,I think the word invasive means species from other places brought to a place were is not their type of habitat. Because in the article it stated that invasive is passing judgement.
6099,3,2,2,Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat plants. Panda bears eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat meat and harm people but pandas and koalas eat nothing but their plants.
21358,8,2,2,"Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul. When they are at the track and Mr. Leonard asks for Pauls name, is a good sign that Mr. Leonard cannot read either. Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share. The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him. Paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time. Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul out, but the only way for him to help is if Paul lets him. Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat. But little by little Paul finds out and it motivates Paul to be a better person, athlete and harder worker."

20351,8,2,2,"When Mr. Leonard is talking to Paul abot his past track years, he told paul he was a good athlete just not a good student. He really connected with Paul when he told he couldnt read. When Paul heard that they had something in common and he knew how to relate to him."
5337,3,1,1,Pandas in China are similar to Koala in Australia because they both only eat food type of food in their natural habitat. They are both different from pythons because pythons just need to have  the right climate to survive  and they will adapt to the different food. For example Pandas only eat bamboo but a python will eat anything.
20213,8,1,1,Mr. Leonard's background informatioon gave Paul incouragement to do better and push harder.
