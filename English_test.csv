For example Pandas only eat bamboo but a python will eat anything.
5338,3,0,0,"Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists as they are different from the python because the python is a generalists. There are more pythons because the word today ""favors generalists rather than specialists"" says one sentence in the article."
5339,3,1,1,"From reading this article I can say pandas in China are much like koalas in Austrailia because both animals eat mainly one food. Pandas like to eat mainly bamboo and koalas like to eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. This quality puts both animals in the catagory of specialists. This differs from python because pythons are generalist. The article says generalists are human beings that live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space, unlike pandas and koalas."
5340,3,1,2,"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both need specific foods and substances to survive. I know this because the author says ''a specialist is China's panda wich eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, wich eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.''

8070,4,0,0,I dont no what the would invasive mean.
8071,4,1,1,The word invasive is significant to this article. The author uses the word invasive to describe animals that have immigrated to a new enviornment. Even the tittle: one man's pets another's invasive species is important in this article.
8072,4,0,0,"The significance of the word invasive is meaning the meaning of the word. So invasive would me different because everytime they use the word its before ""species"", like ""They're introduced"" I think that 'invasive' is passing judgment"" or ""to me its on wonderful introduction"". I think the word mean different because there are different type of animals."
8073,4,1,1,"The word ""invasive""  in the article is used in the context of invasive species, eliminating other species and invading the native habitats of other animals. The article discusses the growing amany of invasive python species and the different viewpoints on how to handle it."
8074,4,1,1,"The significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is that these animals are not invasive, they are being introduced to the U.S. by people like RobRay MacInnes, who import them here to sell on the market."
8075,4,0,0,The word invasive like says in the article mean a animals that passed judgement.
8076,4,1,1,"The article focuses on the introduction of the native species of reptiles. These intruders are called invasive species because they tend to conquer or take over the new habitat, forcing out other native species."
8077,4,2,1,"The word invasive is very important to the article and also explains alot about the way the animals act in the area. Without any natural predators the pythons living in the everglades have nothing to kill them to keep their population down. This makes them ""invasive"" because they are taking over a once stable environment."
8078,4,1,1,"I believe in this article ""invasive"" means hidden/unchecked or referred to pythons MaccInnes  uses this word when he states "" I think that invasive  is passing judgement"" he used this because he in happy that pythons are going birth and the number is increasing where others say its ""invasive"" as  in this is not a good thing this is how invasive was used."
8079,4,1,1,"Invasive, meaning a foreign species that has made a home somewhere it isn't native to. For an example, in the article they speaks of how the Nile nonnter lead. can now be found around cape soral. The animal has the word ""Nile"" in its name.. its obviously not a native species to Florida."
8080,4,1,2,The significance of the word invasive is that the python and other reptiles are coming to areas where they don't belong. One man might like the reptile but another man sees that it will backfire on soon harm the habitat. It's living in and expand its population causing that habitat its new habitat where it will now live.
8081,4,1,1,"Invasive means something that invades an area. This is important in the article because the main idea is that pythons are an "" invasive"" species in the Everglades in Florida. without understanding the word invasive, one would not understand the arguements presented by Bob Roy MacInnes or skip show on the positive or negative affects of pythons as invasive species."
8082,4,0,1,"The word ""invasive"" is very appropriate for almost all of the article arguments in both positive and negative ways. Some argue that pythons are not invasive, while some support with counter-arguments that they are not exclusive when it comes to requirements some species are also very invasive and support that the world it is constantly changing."
8083,4,0,0,The significance of the word invasive is passing judgement because in the rest paragraph 7 it says I think that invasive is passing judgement and that's how I think it relates to the story.
8084,4,1,1,"In the article, "" one mans pet, another' invasive species"" by Joel Achenback, the word invasive is very significant. This is because the python is an invasive species. Also the article talks about other invasive species, ""... a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white tailed deer"" (Achenback 4) Lastly, the article corrects ""invasive"" with ""generalist"" when talking about the five mentioned species."
8085,4,1,1,"The significance of ""invasive"" is that there is controversy on whether or not these animals are harmful to society and therefore ""invasive"" or if they are just being introduced to society and they are not doing anything negative."
8086,4,0,1,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article means strange animals, have a place in our society, our homes, with no question. In paragraph 7, ""Invasive species is unfair."" This means that just because their not our everyday animal doesn't mean you can't form a life for them!"
8087,4,2,2,"The word ""invasive"" means intruding. Invasive species, like the python in the everglades are beginning to threat native species. They are new animals that threat biodiversity. These animals can cause animals to become extinct and are generalist so they can adapt to different environments and affect other people and organism's in and existence."
8088,4,1,0,"Invassive as to almost coming right up too. In this article it is used to devicte a species invading and going, were people think it shouldn't be."
8089,4,0,0,"The significance of the word invasive is it can be used as a powerful word. It can also we used to pass judgement on your thoughts and concerns about a topic. According to source two ""even the term invasive species"" is unfair he said, ""They're introduced I think that ""invasive"" is a good judgement. I supose that invasive has a strong meaning behind itself."
8090,4,1,1,The significance of the word invasive is to explain that the animal is invading our home land and people that the animal poses a threat in the article they say that reptiles are invasive species but MacInnes says that government overestimate the threat of these species some are cammercially attractive.
8091,4,0,0,I think that the word invasive is like saying people are not supportive of animals like that because not a lot of people own them and when they an see them there scared because they are not being supportive about them.
8092,4,1,1,"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" is that when people hear it to them it sounds dangerous and leathal but it really doesnt means that. In the article the author wrote that ""Even the term ""Invasive species"" is unfair, they're introduced."" So what he saying is that just because someone calls them ""Invasive species doesnt mean thare harmful, if kept in controlled environment."
8093,4,2,2,"The word, ""invasive"" plays a very important role in the article. Biologists, such as Skip Snow claim that these reptilian species of pythons and lizards are ""invasive"". This conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems. However, some such as RobRay MacInnes, argue otherwise, ""Invasive is the rod of the controversy over these reptiles."

For example, the article says that the pythons in Florida are imperiling five endangered species. This could lead to an unbalance in the enviroment. Invasive animals could also stretch their habitat to a larger area."
8102,4,0,0,"The significance of the word invasive in the article is big due to the fact that this article mainly talks about invasive animals such as snakes, pythons etc. Also it talks about the animals that are not invasive such as the koala and the panda."

9218,4,1,1,"The word ""Invasive"" in this article means a growing number of (on this case) pythons. The first few paragraphs state how then different species population have a rapid increase. The article says how those invasive species are such a ""major threat to biodiversity."" This because many of these animals rebuild the wild."
9219,4,0,0,"The word invasive simply means the area that they live in and the culture. In the article, it shows different animals and their habitat."
9220,4,0,0,I think invasive throughout the article means to introduce a new species in a new place.
9221,4,2,1,"""Invasive"" it means that it will disrupt the ecosystem when it is introduced. In the article, reptiles are labeled as invasive though they actually did not invade of their own record. They were merely introduced and had to fight and eat to survive."
9222,4,0,0,Ushally some places don't allow reptiles so I think it's invasive.
9223,4,2,1,"The word ""invasive"" in the article is significant in that it describes any animal that, when introduced to a new environment poses a threat to other species naturally found in that habitat. For example, Pythons are dangerous because they reproduce well in the everglades, and are willing to eat many species found in Florida."
9224,4,1,0,The word invasive is significant because that it what animals are doing they are invading other environment due to people bringing them.
9225,4,0,0,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is unfair. The snakes didn't invade anything they were introduced. It's just a mean opinion of the snakes becoming welcoming."
9226,4,1,1,Invasive has a significance in the current article. This is supported by  the fact that the article states how people may think. Pythons are invasive or intrusive to the environment while others believe that the python is merely introduced to a new habitat where it shall adopt and survive.
9227,4,0,1,"""Invasive"" is a significant word in the story because not only did the article talk about animal species it talked about humans also being invasive to this planet. The pythons are taking over the Everglades and endangering species and humans are being the same by using up all natural resources."
9228,4,0,0,The invasive was species undergo a lag before proliferating. It's between 199-2002.
9229,4,1,1,The significance of the word invasive is how it's used on species. An invasive species is a species that comes from an area to another and inhabits it. Some harmless species are being stop by the gavament from coming to America.
9230,4,0,1,"The word ""invasive"" is significant through out the article  because it describes the nature of generalists. A python is able to invade whatever country/environment they desire and they don't care what they eat on the way."
9231,4,0,0,"Invasive is significant to the rest of the article. some people consider it wrong to keep pets like reptiles. While others think it's unfair since ""they're introduced."" and that calling them invasive is wrong."
9232,4,1,1,"The word invasive completes the article because, MacInnes thinks it is a great idea to have animals taken out of their habitat. While other scientist believe thy are ""major threats to biodiversity"" These scientist unlike the species are""Invasive"" while MacInnes thinks they are introduced to a new highland. It proves that there are it's cons to introducing animals to new enviroments."
9233,4,0,0,I think that 'Invasive' is passing judgement.
9234,4,0,0,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is like endangered or maybe that they can only in certain conditions."
9235,4,1,1,"The word invasive is used throughout the article because new species that come in ""take over"" the environment. The article says the term ""invasive"" species is unfair because the animals are more introduced."
9236,4,1,1,"The significance of the word invasive is like a type that is not welcomed like in this article the reptiles are not welcomed to the w because they don't belong there, thats why in paragraph 4 the person said the term invasive species is unfair and passing judgement."
9237,4,1,1,"The word invasive to my opinion means dangerous species or reptiles like crocodile, alligators, snakes and lizard (pg4) (para 9) ''Biologist say invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity'' meaning they are a danger to humans."
9238,4,1,0,"The signifance of the word invasive is it states ""is unfair the said, ""They're introduced."" I think that  'invasive' is passing judgement."
9239,4,0,1,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" throughout the article is used in unnecessary terms. In the article it states "" Even the term"" invasive species "" is unfair he said. "" They're 'introduced"". I think that invasive is passing judgements"". Invasive is used because not everyone could find a pet word or a get pet or even a pet at all, and in the article it is proved some people actually find them as a pet rather than an invasive specie."
9240,4,1,1,"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of the article because it is a word that describes organisms that posses a large  ecological threats. The word is also interperated differently among people such as Rob Roy MacInnes new of the term invasive as unfair and thinks introduced would be a better word for the animals."
9241,4,0,0,Invasive is unfair something like if you want my pencil and i want your pen you'r agree with but after i give  you my pencil you don't give me your pen thirdly certain.
9242,4,1,1,The significance of this word from the rest of the article is that the term is unfair to call animals because its passed judgement. This is evident because in the story it says ''it was the best introduction that has ever happened to the Glades in the last 200 years''.
9243,4,2,1,It is important because the word invasive means like an invasion. And an invasion of the python would be like what is happening to the United States. They have never lived there before but now do. It would not be an invasion if they were not threatening biodiversity.
9244,4,1,0,To my knowledge invasive sort of means threat. The significance of this word to the rest of the article is most people would consider the animals sold invasive and or a threat.
9245,4,1,1,"Invasive  is like to invade or proliferating. Like, one third of the continental U.S is potential habitant to pythons. Another example is, pythons are being spotfeel in multiple locations in remote regions of the Everglades."
9246,4,1,1,"The Significance of the word ""invasive"" is that it's basically describing something as being invading. The article said that the python was ""invasive"" because they came into a new region unexpectively."
9247,4,1,2,"The word ""invasive"" is important in this article, because the article talks of the impact ""invasive"" species have on the enviorment. The article talks about what makes a species invasive, a generalist vs. a specialist, and how invasive species affect & might affect the U.S."
9248,4,0,1,RoiRoy McInnes says that the term invasive is unfair. Invasive describes something that enters a local society or group without permission and causes possible trouble. This article deems some exotic animals to be invasive.
9249,4,2,2,"The significance of the word invasive in the article is that it describes a dangerous situation that is occuring in the US. An invasive species is one that is introduced into a foreign environment, and if allowed to remain, can cause much harm to environments and native species. One example is the pythons decreasing the wood rat population in the US."
9250,4,0,0,This article is mainly about python's and python's are a very invasive species.
9251,4,1,1,"In this article invasive means threat. They see reptiles as a threat because if it goes unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodversity that can affect wild life."
9252,4,1,1,"Invasive meaning that they did not originate there and are moving in. The burmers python for example did not originat in the everglades. They started of as house pets then escaped and populated. When they did, they wiped out other species."
9253,4,0,0,In the article they called the python invasive and said they're more introduced. I think they're invasive and I don't think They should be considered pets at all.
9254,4,1,0,""" Invasive"" is important to the article because the articles about how the reptiles coming to parts of the U.S are invasive. Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair said RobRoy Mac Innes."
9255,4,0,0,"The significance of the word invasive as a term that questions the story. The term ""invasive species is unfair ... "" They're introduced. I think that invasive is passing judgement."""
9256,4,1,1,"''Invasive'' is when an organism is introduced to a new environment and kills off  the natives. In the article, the python is described as invasive because it killing out or eats natives and thrives i the new environment."
9257,4,1,0,"Invasive is to to be wide spread and escape in a mass area. For example, in the teat pythons escaped because of the hurricane in 1992 and the following years they have been seen in many other different locations."
9258,4,0,0,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that some people feel that pets such as lizards and snakes (especially dangerous ones) belong out in the wild not in anyone's bedroom. On the other hand, some people feel like keeping reptiles as pets are great because they are low maintained and easy to take care of."
9259,4,1,1,"The word invasive relates to this article in a way, because snakes are migrating into our country. Since much of the Souths Climate is similar to the snakes climate they can live in the area, "" A USGS map showed ... python habitat stretching from CA to Delaware, including much of the South""."
9260,4,1,1,"The word ""invasive"" has a great significance in the article. The articles main question is whether or not pythons and other generalists are invading countries or not. While people such as MacInnes argue that they are just adapting to new environments, others such as Snow, argue that they are taking over. It is left to the reader to decide if the animals are ""invasive"""
9261,4,0,0,"To me, invasive means an amount. In this article, its showing the amount of reptiles that has sather on the United States."
9262,4,1,1,In this article the word invasive is thrown around. I think the word is completely appropriate because the cobras do not belong in places they are not native to. The cobra is invading land it should not be on.
9263,4,1,1,Invasive mean to invade or take over a place. In the article the word invasive is significance because its use to tell how python have become an invasive species speically in place like the Everglades in the Florida key.
9264,4,1,1,"The significance of the word ''invasive'' means something has been found a place where it wasn't found before. & pythons/snakes were seen places that they weren't seen before. In paragraph 11''what's certain is that by 2002, pythons were seen in multiple locations in the remote regions of the Everglades.''"
9265,4,1,1,"The word invasive means your coming into someones territory. In paragraph 12 we see snakes have gone invasive and are popping up in many places of the world. In this case by the snakes being invasive of other animals we are being invasive of other animals, we are now starting to see animal extinctions happen."
9266,4,0,0,"The word ""invasive"" is the base of the article. Some people, like RobRoy MacInnes, consider the word rude. While Skip Snow thinks it's the correct word to describe these animals."
9267,4,1,1,Invasive to me means taking over. I believe it means this because reptiles are becoming more common pets all over the world. It seems they're spreading around rapidly.
9268,4,1,1,The significance of the word invasive means invading like its not sapose to be here. Its a more harsh word than introduced. its like their trying to say the reptiles are taking over and the reptile population is booming.
9269,4,2,1,"In this article the word invasive is used to describe pythons an invasive species. Invasive species are animals that are introduced to an ecosystem that hasn't experienced them, and disrupt the natural way ''of that ecosystem, the ''invasive'' pythons are imperiling 5 endangered species in the Florida keys.''"
9270,4,2,2,"These invasive species are considered invasive because they weren't supposed to originally be here. This causes an unbalance in the ecosystem. As the article states in paragraph 11, the snakes have imperiled 5 endangered species in the Florida keys. Once they went native, they didn't go back. Causing tennoil in balanced environments it makes sense they've been dubbed ""invasive""."
9271,4,1,1,"Invasive means intruding or tespassing. If you are invasive, you are unwanted. The snakes are called invasive species in this article because some feel they are unwanted, like the people of Florida. However others, like MacInnes, it is an offensive term, b/c he says they are ""introduced""."
9272,4,1,1,The word ''invasive'' is significant to the rest of the article because it makes the reader automatically think invading and then they already have their mind made up prior to even reading arguments for and against the so called ''invasive'' species.
9273,4,1,0,"I think the significance of the word "" invasive"" is ""passing judgement"". In the article says for a pythons its a good introduction because ""However invasive species unchecked by natural predators, are major threat to biodiversity for example a pythons, a crocodile, snakes, and other lethal species."
9274,4,1,1,Invasive means that the they taken over the article is mostly about pythons and how they have become an invasive species that's taking over the warmer climates almost one third of the United States.

9276,4,0,0,The term invasive means that they are old and used. Pythons spread to different parts of the country so they still way be new.
9277,4,1,1,"In the article the word ""invasive"" is very significant because it describes how the newly introduced species are harming our environment and other species. Biologists, however, say that invasive species,unchecked  by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity which clearly states that the new species will harm what we have now."
9278,4,1,0,"The word ""invasive"" is a word to describe something that is invading. In this article the pythons are an invasive species and are invading the everglades."
9279,4,1,1,The significance of the word invasive is like an example of the pythons invading other countries. They inhabit places that have a climate one third similar to the United States.
9280,4,1,1,"The word ""invasive"" is significant because it means to invade to interrupt people like skip snow, are saying that these new animals are interrupting animals that are already living in that habitat. And interrupting tourists."
9281,4,0,0,"The word ""invasive"" means rare or going extinct. The invasive species would be the pythons before they boomed in America. Now there are plenty of pythons. Basically, we should take better care of the endangered species. ""...Hurricane Andrew... played a factor in a wholesale python jailbreak in 1992"". Before they were endangered, but now they aren't."
9282,4,1,0,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is that there judging the animals because is a huge threat to the natural animals and environment."
9283,4,1,1,"Invasive species are animals that ""unchecked by predators, are major threats to biodiversity"", (Achenbach).

9284,4,0,1,"The word invasive means that that animal or species can easily adapt to their surrounding and make a new home. But this is by their own will, if a human brings them into an area it will be different."
9285,4,2,2,"The word invaisive is significant to this article. This article talks about how pythons & other generalized species can live in countries with the same climate as their homeland. But, when these animals move to a new country they invade the enviorment of the animals that are living there. Many bad events can occur because the ecosystem in that area is disrupted by the invaision of the new organism."
9286,4,1,1,Invasive is certainly a significant need in the article. This is because it whole how python have entered the wild by being introduced or invading it then the rest of the article talks about whether as not this is a good thing for the everglades.
9287,4,0,0,"The significance of the word ""Invasive "" as the article said is to make people fearful  of the idea of invasive species. Also are seen  through their fear. The article informs  the reader of the spread of invasive species."

9289,4,1,1,"The significance of the word invase is important. Mac Innes explains how the term invasive is unfair. He says, ""They're introduced, I think invasive is passing judgement."" Invasive in the article means a threat which to many means judging a animal without giving them a chance to prove the word wrong like MacInnes said."

9291,4,0,1,"Invasive is a reoccurring word in this article. Pythons is an invasive species able to live and eat another. Also, many intrasive species undergo a lag before proliferating (source). Many species are not intrasive, so when it comes to pythons the main idea of the idea of the story; Intrasive is a definition to there habit. Other animals are not like them making the word so much more significant."
9292,4,1,1,"The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is huge. It means that certain animals don't belong in certain places.

9312,4,1,1,The significance of the word invasive is obsecured. People say its unfair to use on the pythons because the python is such a snake in Florida according to (paragraph 7). One person think that its a wonderful introduction. But really invasive species are major threats to the biodiversity and news moved around the world so fast according to paragraph 9.
9313,4,1,1,"Invasive is implying that they are taking over and destroying what was there before. This word is significant because it shows that instead of the animals just living there, they are driving th old species out as well."
9314,4,1,2,"So this story the word ""invasive"" meant they are ""unchecked by natural predators, and are major threat to biodiversity."" They meant that they are really dangerous for the environment and would really affect the population of the species they eat."
9315,4,0,0,"The term ""invasive"" is crucial to this article because it's harsh meaning resembles the way people think of reptiles. Reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, are generally treated badly. People are fearful and are disgursted by them. The term ""invasive"" implies harsh cold attitude like the one often given to reptiles."
9316,4,0,1,"Invasive is a very significant word. In paragraph 7 they say, ""I think that 'invasive' is meaning judgement about Animals,bugs, and also reptiles."
9317,4,1,1,Some of the scientists in this article are saying that there reptiles are invasive but their not this reptiles are being introduced to this habitat  by custrmere into purchased reptiles. And invasive is when a certain species of plant or animal invade a place where the are not native.

9319,4,2,2,"Invasive species refer to animals/species that was introduced to an area it did originally live in. This means that other animals,spreading endangered species, will not be introduced to having them there. According to the article, pythons are endangering five species in the Florida in US. This is because they are not used to having pythons there."
9320,4,0,0,The word invasive has a lot of significance because Mac Innes believes the term is unfair and is passing judgement and the whole article is based on his studies.
9321,4,0,0,"Well in the article it states that one man's pet, another's Invasive Species."" I'm guessing the word invassive means a reptile, animals that many people don't have."

9323,4,0,0,Invasive is significant because it's saying that some reptiles are invasive. Pythons don't belong here in the United states.
9324,4,1,1,I believe the significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is to be completely out  of control. The reason why I believe this is because in the article MacInnes got offended and stated ''even the term invasive species'' is unfair. ''Reading that told me that it was something harsh enough to take offense to.
9325,4,1,1,"The word invasive means in this case that the animals change rapidly. This is a threat to biodiversity, because they cant controll how fast its changing."
9326,4,1,1,I believe that describing these animals as invasive is very fitting their characteristics. These animals have invaded the everglades and its surrounding areas when there are repponts of the animals under the hood of a tourists col then the animal is definitly invasive.
9327,4,0,0,"Invasive are species like snake. In the article, it says that ""Even the term"". Invasive species"" is unfair. ""They're introduced,' that invasive is passing judgment."

9332,4,1,1,Invasive is very signifacant word in this article. It is signifacant because it shows why these pythons are bad. In paragraph 9 it says that invasive species are big threats to biodiversity.

9334,4,0,0,The word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because the article is talking about pythons who are invasive species and explaining how they are becoming less and less invasive as years go by because now there are more being seen in various other locations around the world.
9335,4,0,0,Invasive was constantly used through out the article.
9336,4,0,0,"Even the term 'invasive species' is unfair, MacInnes said. They're 'introduced.' I think that ""invasive"" is passing judgement."
9337,4,0,0,"I think invasive means avoidable and shouldn't be around. According to MacInnes, ""Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said. ""They're introduced."" In other word ""invasive is saying the new kinds of pet aren't wanted."
9338,4,0,0,The word invasive is used a lot in this article to explain what type of animal a reptile is when they use that word they're making it known that those animals are quite dangerous and are hard to be picked as sutible pets.
9339,4,0,0,"The word ""Invasive"" can mean many things but in the article it means out of control. This conclusion has been made due to the information in paragraph 7. Which happens to say ""Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair""."
9340,4,2,1,"The word invasive is used to describe the pythons since they were introduced into a different habitat and are endangering other animals such as the key largo wood rat. Also, they say that scientists aren't happy with people who are introducing invasive species to their habitats because they might decrease biodiversity."
9341,4,0,1,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article means to be harmful, or is harmful. The word invasive is being used to describe the pythons as harmful to man kind. The title of the story is ""One man's pet, Another's invasive species."" The title says it all. Some people accept the reptile as a pet being non-harmful, others think they are a specieces that is very harmful."
9342,4,0,0,"Invasive; one mans pet, anothers invasive species, meaning it can be someone else's pet today but later tonight when it get hungry it will be a very dangerous wild creature."
9343,4,0,0,The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article shows that the species who do come into a new habitat are not monsters. The reason for MacInnes to say more of as''introduction species'' is b/c invasive sounds more of a bad thing when on this case it isn't.
9344,4,0,0,"The word invasive isn't a good word to use in this article be it ""is passing judgment"" and it ""is unfair"""

17120,7,0,0,"Rose is a good person and wants to do everything she can for the family. When she talks to Aunt Kolab, and when her Aunt offers to sell some baked goods, Rose feels a burden lifted off her shoulders. One exmple from the story, is that when her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'

She knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister, but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college. That shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life."
17125,7,2,2,"Rose is compassionate. Rose asks how Anna feels, she would not ask this unless she cares about her. The reason she cares about her is that Anna is Rose's sister"
17126,7,1,1,"Rose is sympathetic when having a conversation with her sister Anna.

In the story, it states that Anna says, 'You sound just like Mama.' This shows that Rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship.

Rose likes to put other people before herself. She is a caring person but she sometimes doesn't understand when it is to much. After talking with her aunt she realized that she couldnt weigh herself down with other peoples problems. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That quote is from the story, and that quote is what made me infer what type of person Rose was.

17246,7,1,1,"She is caring. She talks to her sister, lessons to her and tells her that money isn't everything."
17247,7,0,0,"In the story your perspective is from Rose.  Rose, like other humans, has many traits to her personality.  One trait that you can see is giving.  An example of this is how she works to help her brother get through college.  She seems to be constantly busy, but doesn't outrightly complain about it.  This is an example of a trait I find Rose has."
17248,7,0,0,"To me, Rose seems like a competitive girl. She doesn't want to loose. Meaning by that, the fact stating, she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'Even if I win, I won't get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize.' This means she wants to win. She won't give up on her dreams."
17249,7,0,0,"I think Rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted. In the passage it replies, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' This example supports my answer why i think Rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted."

Also with all the rsponsibility he had when he was there is now passed on to Rosa which is causing her to not have any time to do anything.
17255,7,2,2,"One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings."
17256,7,0,0,One trait that Rose is dealing with is poverty. Rose feels she does not do enough to help. Rose's father moved else-where to get more money for the family. Paul is going to college trying to make it through. Poverty is sad to say is what trait Rose was stricten with.

17261,7,2,2,"One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring. Rose is caring as shown through the part of the story where she is cautious to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels weighed down by the support she offers the family.  Rose takes time to ponder if she should tell her Aunt Kolab because she fears she will hurt her, and her mother.  Rose does not want to hurt her family, therefore she is caring."
17262,7,2,2,"Based on the conversations between Rose and Anna, Rose seems to be a person who is trying to be positive and strong for her family.  When Anna brings up their missed father, she blames him for leaving the family.  Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money."

17276,7,0,0,"One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations would be Stubborn, I think that Rose is very stubborn and somewhat ungrateful. she is stubborn because she complains about everything, she doesnt take anything for granted and never wants to give up on what she wants. In a way its a good thing that Rose is stubborn because people cant take advantage of her and she wont stop trying something until she wins. But on the other hand she can hurt people and can be annoying. this is the trait I chose that best fits Rose."
17277,7,0,0,Rose is very weighed down by all of the stresses in her life. Her Aunt Kolab infers her struggling and offers to help Rose in their conversation at the end of the story.
17278,7,0,0,"Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother."

17288,7,0,0,Anna is a helper. She helps a lot around the house even though she does not like to do it.
17289,7,0,0,"Rose is a very busy girl, often tied down with taking care of her sister Anna, and wanting her mother home. But she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is. At the end of this story, She realized that she can survive this family splitting all by herself when she said, 'Suddenly it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague. Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'"
17290,7,0,0,"Rose seems very overwhelmed. In paragraph thirteen, Rose is even troubled in her sleep about her overwhelming problems during the day. This suggest that her life has become busy to the point of an overwhelming capacity."
17291,7,0,0,"In this story, Rose bears a lot of responsibility. Everyone in the family must work in order to pay for Paul's education which will help the family as a whole. Rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything. She is conflicted to say the least."
17292,7,1,1,Rose is a very caring person. She gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family. One example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to Sacramento anyways. She would have to stay home and take care of her family.
17293,7,0,0,She is stuburn and wants things her way because she just rolled her eyes and stormed out of the room.
17294,7,0,0,"In conversing with her sister, Rose continually reassures her of the brightness of the future, attempting to laugh and sound optimistic. She herself takes on the task of writing the essay, an unnecessary burden on top of her numerous tasks, suggesting that she is trying to repress a feeling of doubt that she shares with her sister. Thus a prominent characteristic of Rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her family's condition, taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally."
17295,7,2,2,"One trait that descibes Rose based on the conversation between her and Anna is that she is helpful in many ways. To me it seems that Rose is more of the mother figure in Anna's life and is there for her when she needs something. She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working. An example of the book of how Rose shows this trait is when Anna woke up and came into where Rose was, Rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay."
17296,7,0,0,"In the story Rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone. She says'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. I think that Rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so."
17297,7,2,2,Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot. Rose is very persistent. One example is in paragraph two. Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do. Then how she has to work to help support her entire family.
17298,7,1,1,Rose is helpful.  She works to help support Paul and the rest of her family.  Anna and Aunt Kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family.
17299,7,0,0,Rose seems a bit overloaded according to her conversation with Aunt Kolab
17300,7,2,1,"One trait I found in this story about Rose, would be that she is caring. Her Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose is to caring about her Aunt's feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings."
17301,7,1,1,"Rose is a hardworker. In the beginning of the story, she explains going to school, heading straight to work for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help make dinner. After all of that, she still has to do homework."
17302,7,2,2,"She cares for her family. When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'"
17303,7,0,0,"Rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with Anna.  When she tries to to explain to Anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help Paul finish college, she calmly speaks to Anna, even though she knows Anna may not fully understand.  Even though Anna clearly did not understand what Rose was saying, she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards Anna's retort at the end of the conversation.  Instead, she remains tolerant, which takes a great deal of patience on her part."
17304,7,2,2,Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful. 'Rose didn't answer. If she to;d the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself.
17305,7,0,1,"Rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place. When Anna says 'It feels like he's been gone for years,' Rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months, and that they needed the money."
17306,7,1,1,I think a trait that Rose has is caring. Rose is caring because she cares about her family and understands what things are going on and tries to help her sister understand. She also is like a leader to her sister.
17307,7,0,0,"She seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks, 'whats wrong? You feel okay?', and when the sister replies that she had a bad dream she doesnt ask why or what happend."
17308,7,1,1,"She understands the importance of finacial need. When she stated that her dad moved away to another job that paid three times what he was making before, reveals that she has some intelligance in money."
17309,7,0,0,"Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab suggests that Rose is very mature and responsible for her age. Rose's aunt can see how much stress she is under. Rose doesn't say anything though, knowing the family needs money to survive. When Aunt Kolab says something to Rose about being 'weighed down by helping the family,' Rose admits she's under much stress."
17310,7,0,0,"There mad that their mom has to work so late.''Mamas not home yet is he', 'I hate how late she has to work'"

17312,7,2,2,She cares about her sister Anna. This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong'? and 'are you feeling ok'?
17313,7,0,0,"When Rose's sister walked and asked what's worng? Rose tried to tell than she was fine that just she had another bad dream. Rose's sister said the money isn't everything, then Rose tell to her sister than they have to help Paul, so Anna dislike for that. 'You sond just like Mama'. Anna wants to mean that Rose start to think and talk like her mother."
17314,7,0,0,One trait that can descibe Rose is exhausted.she is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family. She must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do. Rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework.
17315,7,2,2,"One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring. That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person. The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom.' That indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom. She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too."
17316,7,0,0,"Rosa feels that she weiged down by her family, and theres is not much she can do about it.  The floashback that involved her brother  standing on top of her in the water, sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help."
17317,7,0,0,The conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab was a good sisters relationship.
17318,7,0,0,"One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations with Anna is pessimistic. She doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as Anna would like it to. You can see that by Anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how Paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees. Rose acts accordingly and compares Anna to her mother, which shows that Anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story."
17319,7,0,0,"1. she doesn't like to see people disappointed or u- happy. for example 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'"
17320,7,0,0,"Rose is a self-absorbed American teenager.  She feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders.  She does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard.  Her Aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised.  Since Rose feels she has to much burden, Aunt Kolab says, 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal'."
17321,7,0,0,"I think that Rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life. She works to help out the family but at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper. I think that she feels the same way Anna does but doesnt want to admit it. With her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom, dad, or even Paul."
17322,7,1,1,"She works hard for her family. She went to school, worked for four hours after, then had to help her aunt with dinner, after she had homework that must be completed. She had no time to finish the essay."
17323,7,1,1,"She is wanting to make everything good for her and her family because her dad is gone, so she is working very hard to keep up. But it is alot of work and she is having trouble getting everything done in time.

17326,7,0,0,Rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells Anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money.
17327,7,1,1,Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
17328,7,1,1,"Hardworking. Rose is a very hard working individual. She has school, work, housework, and homework. She takes on more responsibilites than she can probably handle but she does it all for the good of the family. You can see Rose's hardworking efforts as she goes above and beyond to win a essay contest. She puts more on her plate than she can eat but she takes every challenge head on. You can tell she is working hard from the stress that is related to us through her character. She is strong for her sister, making everything seem just peachy, but right when she has the chance, she breaks down to her Aunt, let's her know how she really feels."
17329,7,1,1,"One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. Whether she wants to do something or not, she still gets it done. An example from the story is the fact that she goes to school, works a four- hour shift right after, home to help her aunt  prepare supper, and then does homework."
17330,7,0,0,"Rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis. I know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper, because of school, work, preparing supper, and doing homework."
17331,7,0,0,Rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl. Rose has re-occurring dreams about things of her brother.

17332,7,0,0,"One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstations with Anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are.  One example from the story that shows this is when Anna and Rose are talking about her father being gone and to Anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone.  Rose jus responded with a simple answer of, 'It's only been four months.'"
17333,7,0,0,That Rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
17334,7,2,2,Rose said ' What's wrong? You feel okay?' that is a trait of love.
17335,7,2,2,"Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself."
17336,7,0,0,Rose feels very weighed down because she has too much on her plate and it drives her insane because she also has to do a bunch for her family too and she feels presured not to give up and to help as much as she can and I know this because of when she had that conversation with her aunt at the end she had her aunt explain what she was feeling in a different perspective.
17337,7,2,2,"Rose is very selfless, she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt. Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself."
17338,7,2,2,"Rose is very caring about her family. She sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay, along with her family, to get her brother through college.

17342,7,2,2,"She hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others, like when she didn't want to tell the truth and hurt her Aunt."
17343,7,0,0,It is easily surmisable from the text that Rose can be described as burdened.  It is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her.
17344,7,2,2,"One trait that I saw in Rose during her conversation with Anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it. Also, that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive. For example, Rose said to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.

17347,7,0,0,Rose is paranoid. She is paranoid with how her life is going with her mother working late and her father moving away to work somewhere else.  This is shown when she keeps having bad dream.

17349,7,0,0,One trait I identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felt.A detail from the story is when Rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay. She was more concerned about the essay then Rose's bad dream or how she was feeling.
17350,7,1,1,The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
17351,7,0,0,I think she is desolate and worn out. She works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself.

17354,7,2,2,"One trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with Aunt Kolab is that you can really feel what Rose is actually feeling. You can almost make a connection, with Rose and how she has to deal with life, for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her Aunt. So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too. You feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone."
17355,7,1,1,"Rose has a great trait, the trait she has is will-power. Rose does a lot for the family and she doesn't really ask for anything in return.'Rose didn't answer one of Aunt Kolab's questions because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.'"
17356,7,1,1,Rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not self-centered. She is an trustworthy person and is very reliable. And she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit.

17359,7,0,0,"Rose is a very afraid to let any one down.  This trait is both good and bad for her personality.  It is a good thing because, she is always there when someone needs something.

Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father. I see Rose as a caring girl.
17362,7,0,0,One trait that can discribe Rose is she woulod like everything to be her way and if it does not go her way she does not wont to do it.'Ann is mom home yet .' 'Rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer.'
17363,7,0,0,"Rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings.  The reason I say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says, Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother."
17364,7,0,0,"When Rose is talking to Anna after anna pours two glasses of orange juice, Rose says that she is lonesome for Papa. He has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years."
17365,7,1,1,She works really hard and its for her family. She would do anything for her family and they would do the same for her.She is over working herself though. She needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house. But she does it anyway.For her brother.
17366,7,2,2,"In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings."
17367,7,0,0,"Rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings. In her conversation with Anna, she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help Paul get through college. It takes a strange dream and some probing by Aunt Kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation."
17368,7,0,0,"I think that Rose is strong. In the story, it says that she was talking to her sister in the kitchen and that she was trying to help her sister understand their situation and help her come to better terms with it even though she felt the same way."
17369,7,0,0,I think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter.
17370,7,0,0,One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is worried. She is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down. The dream in which Paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer.
17371,7,0,0,They are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to Los Angelous for his work.  They both knew that he was making more money that ever.
17372,7,0,0,"One trait that I can see in Rose is that she doesn't want to her her aunt by telling her the truth.  Also, by listening to her Aunt Kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier.  I think the reason is her Aunt Kolab seems to help people see the good in life."
17373,7,0,0,"One trait that can describe Rose's trait would be while shes listening to Aunt Kolab. She doesn't directly answer her aunt cause she's afraid of hurting her aunt, or her aunt telling her mother. For instance Aunt Kolab says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded."
17374,7,0,0,"she is a busy body, cause she always has stuff to do."
17375,7,0,0,BUSY'When would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
17376,7,0,0,she is always busy
17377,7,1,1,"Rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with Aunt Kolab. As her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things, Rose nods away at what Aunt Kolab says. Although she still questions it in her head, she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future."
17378,7,1,1,That she is worried about her family.
17379,7,1,1,Rose seems to be very kind. She didn't want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with Anna.
17380,7,0,0,"Rose is a very busy girl. She has to deal with being in high school, having a job, helping her Aunt Kolab with house work, and she has to write a three thousand word essay."
17381,7,2,2,One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring.  I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad.  Rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money.
17382,7,0,0,"She grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in Cambodia. She has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking  her down to the bottom of a body of water, and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes."
17383,7,2,2,"Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as caring because she puts her sister's needs before her own. Although she needs to write a three thousand word essay, she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father."
17384,7,2,2,Rose is very thankful. Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt. What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope.
17385,7,2,2,"One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all."
17386,7,2,2,"Rose can be described by hopeful.  She is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future.  When Rose and Anna are talking at the beginning of the story, Rose talks about how once Paul finishes college, he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college."
17387,7,0,0,"Rose was nice to her sister at first, But then kinda got angry. In the story they were talking about their dad, and Rose made Anna mad."
17388,7,0,0,"I feel like rose is very stressed. In the second paragraph, the first sentence, rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding. Then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesn't feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay."
17389,7,1,1,"Personally, I believe that Rose is sincere. She is trying to help her family, to the best of her ability, but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances. In this story, Rose goes through her to-do list for a typical evening. You would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age, but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going. I wish we could all have her sincerety."
17390,7,1,1,The one trait that Rose has is to work hard fo rher family to get by without some of her family memebers. I get this support because her sister and her have a talk about mone yand that her dad is gone and her mother works a long shift just to get money for them to survive.
17391,7,1,1,"One trait that describes Rose is a hard worker.  She goes to school every day, then goes to wrork, and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework.  She still get everything done and that is why Rose is a hard worker."
17392,7,0,0,she isnt very happy
17393,7,2,2,I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
17394,7,1,0,"Rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family, but the pressure only weighs down on her more. This is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister, Anna. Despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her, she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely."
17395,7,2,2,"She seems hopeful, even though she has it rough. When she was telling her sister about how Paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job, Anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didn't really believe it was going to work out."
17396,7,0,0,"She seems iritated and tired, because in the story she wakes up and says oh, no and groaned. This shows that she is very unpleased and that she is very tired and irritable."
17397,7,2,2,"She cares about others. She didn't answer her aunt because, she didn't want to hurt her."
17398,7,1,1,She is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast.
17399,7,0,0,"she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family, and writing 1000 word essay, than the pressure for paul."
17400,7,0,0,Rose tells Anna and Aunt Kolab that she is in some way being weighed down. Rose had a dream that Paul was holding her down.
17401,7,0,0,Rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things. In the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wanna hear.
17402,7,1,1,I believe that in the story Rose is a very brave responsibal girl. During the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country.
17403,7,1,1,"In the story the conversation with rose and aunt Kolab would describe Rose as a helping person. She dosen't mind helping out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother."
17404,7,0,0,"Rose is dismissive and a little passive. She answers her aunt truthfully, but only with non-verbal communication. This shows shes dissmissve for the subject."
17405,7,0,0,"Rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her- a rough job, taxing schoolwork, and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else. '...From school she'd gone straight to the  restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'"
17406,7,1,1,Well she is caring and nice.
17407,7,2,2,Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab. She is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother.
17408,7,2,2,concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna. she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .
17409,7,0,0,"Rose seems to be worried about money in her coversation with Anna, a detail that supprts this when she brings up the fact that her dad is making more money now , away from them, than he did with them."
17410,7,2,2,"In the passage 'Crossing Over', Rose has many different traits, but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility. When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What's wrong?' This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna. Then when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her lets the reader know that Rose has a big resposibility with the family. When her aunt says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family. The two examples that are given are small but imply much more that, Rose is almost like a second mother for her family."
17411,7,0,0,Rose is
17412,7,0,0,One trait that can describe Rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves. Rose and Anna have to help Paul finish college and when Paul is out of college he'll pay for Rose and Anna.
17413,7,2,2,One trait that Rose shows is compasion. She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States. Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate. She does so many things to be accomplished that she doesn't care how stressed out she is. All she wants is a good life for her and her family.
17414,7,0,0,Rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time. When her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer.
17415,7,1,1,Rose is responsible when it says 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurent to work a four-hour shitft' this shows he responsibilty and what position she holds in her family.
17416,7,0,0,Rose feels like she is being weighed down and can't help her family. When Rose is asked by momma if she is weighed down and she looks at her and just walks away ignoring her.
17417,7,2,2,"In the tory, when Rose said to Anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college. This shows a trait of being optimistic. Also, whe talking to her aunt, although she said things probably won't get much better, she stayed on the plus said and said, maybe they will."
17418,7,1,1,"One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when Anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants Papa home, thats being self-centered.  Rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family."
17419,7,0,0,"Rose is unhappy, and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better. She doesn't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much. An example of this is when Rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay. She tells Anna that they need to do this for thier brother, and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be. She also jokes about money with Anna as if things were alright with money at this time."
17420,7,2,2,"The one trait I think that describes rose is, that she is caring. I say this because, when she was talking to her aunt, she wanted to tell her the dream she had. She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her."
17421,7,0,0,"Rose seems like a very open person. She uses personification when the narrator said, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.' This just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly."
17422,7,2,2,Rose is caring. Her conversation with Anna shows this. Rose asks Anna if she feels okay.
17423,7,2,2,"During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't tell her how she feels. This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother. She also says that to Anna, that he is the one that can help them get to college.She is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college."
17424,7,0,0,One trait that can describe rose is respectful because when Aunt Kolab asked her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family' Rose doesn't say anything because she did not want to hurt her Aunt's feelings or her mothers.
17425,7,2,2,"She is very sincere and thinks about other people's and cares about other people's feelings. Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt."
17426,7,1,1,Rose feels weighed down because of how much she's trying to help her family. She feels like she has to carry most of the problems. In the conversation Rose has with her Aunt Kolab towards the end of the story her Aunt specifically asks her if she feels weighed down by what she's doing to help her family and Rose doesn't answer. It gives proof that she does not want to tell her Aunt or her mother.

17431,7,1,1,"Rose is a girl who is always putting her family first. Though she fights with her sister and has terrible dreams about the weight put on her shoulders that she explains to her aunt, she still always tries to put her family first. She takes the dreams shes been having and relates them to everyday life in Cambodia and later finds a topic for a state championship essay that would help her family out greatfully."
17432,7,0,0,"Rose talks to her sister Anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money.  Rose doesn't like that her mom works so late and her dad had to move so he could get a better job for his family.  Anna said it helps them a lot because of the money they make, but all Rose wants to do is see her dad and mom more."
17433,7,0,0,She is very brave. It takes alot of courage to write a long essay like that and have to present it at a state competition. She is also brave for talking to her aunt about what is going on.
17434,7,1,1,Rose tries to put things lightly so that she wont hurt others feelings. This becomes apparent when she is talking to Anna about their father and trying to comfort Anna.
17435,7,0,0,Rose works too much she works after school and has to do her homework and come back and take care or her bothers and sisters.
17436,7,0,0,I could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her. Her aunt sees that and offers to make some stuff to sell that comes from her country.
17437,7,0,0,One trait to describe Rose would be guilt because of the dream she has about Paul jumping off the boulder and landing on her in the water.
17438,7,0,0,In Rose's conversation with Anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation. When she explains to Ana that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is telling her this just to make her stop worrying. Rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation.
17439,7,0,0,She understands how important school is
17440,7,1,0,"Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose is an understanding person. Anna is still young so she can not fully understand why her family is working so hard. Rose explains to her its for the enitire family; for her brother and themselves. Rose overworks herself with school and work but she knows its for her family so keeps on perservering, ignoring the fact that she feels too much responsibility for her age."
17441,7,1,0,"Rose, judging by her unwillingness to speak about how she felt to her Aunt Kolab, works as hard as she does because she does not wish to let her family down."
17442,7,0,0,"When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt tells Rose that now she can tell that Rose is seeing the problems and situations through other eyes. I think what she is saying is that now Rose is seeing life in a new perspective, that now she doesn't just think that their family is having a hard time financially, that now she knows by trying to be a part of the problems and help to resolve them."
17443,7,2,2,"One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. In paragraph 11, Rose is talking to Anna about money and Rose makes the comment that their part is help Paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college. Their family is having problems and their dad just moved away to have a better paying job and Rose is looking on the bright side and how the outcome will be good if they just don't give up."

17445,7,0,0,"She thinks its all about money.Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything.'     'Only if you already have verything,' Rose said."
17446,7,0,0,"One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. The story shows this when it talks about how most of her days are long when she has to go to school, then the restaurant, then home to help with dinner, and finally to do homework. This relates to her conversation with Aunt Kolab when her Aunt can see how hard she is working and how exhausted she is when Rose comes down in the morning. Her Aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family."
17447,7,1,1,"Rose is very willing to persevere and accompolish her goals.One could seen this in the end when she is talking to Aunt Kolab,   'Rose kept nodding.  Mayber her life would get easier.'"
17448,7,0,0,Rose doesnt like to say her true feelingsParagraph 21 line 1 and paragraph 23 line 1 it says she just keeps on nodding.
17449,7,1,1,"Rose, to me, seems like a very understanding person. She listens to her sister when she is resentfull about there father and mother, and tries to explain it so that she can better understand the situation herself. Rose also shows that she is understanding when her aunt comes to her with more ideas on ways to help out there older brother Paul."
17450,7,2,1,Rose's sense of responsibity is evident in her conversation with Anna. her ability to suppress her own feelings to try and make things easier for her sister is a great personal trait.
17451,7,1,1,"Rose is a very determined person. You can tell this from the story, because she is working hard in the resturant, making dinner for her family at home, and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time. By reading conversations she had with her Aunt Kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person. Aunt Kolab says , 'Do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' also shows that Rose is a very determined person."
17452,7,1,1,She is hopeful that her future will be worth the work she puts in. She just needs to make out of this rough patch in life.
17453,7,2,2,"Rose is caring and trys to comfort her sister Anna, when Anna is down because her parents are never home. Rose says to Anna in the story that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' Rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away."
17454,7,2,2,"Rose, to me, seems to be a very hard working person. In the story she tells us she has work most days right after school, then help with dinner, and finally do homework. By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone. She doesn't like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person, she is making sure she never disapoints her family. She knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education."
17455,7,0,0,'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' 'It's only been four months.' This tells me that Rose is a family girl. She is not happy unless her family is with her and supporting her. She is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in Los Angeles.
17456,7,1,1,"She is strong inside, because even under pressure she tries to help her family."
17457,7,2,2,Rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family.  Rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school.  She works instead of plays so that her brother can get through school and take care of her rather than the other way around.
17458,7,1,1,"One trait that that can decscribe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be worried. My example from the context would be, 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'"
17459,7,1,1,"She is very hardworking, and she cares about her family. In the story it says that after school she went straight to work and straigh home to help prepare supper."
17460,7,0,0,She in a way feels like she cares about the essay but if she does win than she cant pick up the prize anyway so she feels that there isnt realy a point in trying to win and her schedual is already realy busy as it is.

17462,7,1,1,"Rose is a very responsible girl. She has more of a load on her than most girls her age would. She worries about money, her brother, and her father. Her Aunt Kolab says that what they are doing is normal in Cambodia. This makes Rose feel better and relieves her of some of the stresses that she feels in everyday life."
17463,7,2,2,I think that Rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better. Rose wouldn't tell Aunt Kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
17464,7,2,2,"Caring, when she is talking to Anna she does as much as she can to be nice and comfort her about what is happening."
17465,7,0,0,Rose thinks that there is something wrong with Anna.
17466,7,1,1,"Rose is a hard working lady, that wants to do good things for herself.She is wanting to write this three thousand word essay, but cant fit it into her schedule. She wants to become a winner."

17469,7,1,1,"One trait that can be used to descripe Rose, is positive. Rose is always looking towards the bright side of each situation, no matter how bad the conditions. Also, she keeps a strong attitude when her little sister talks to her about her feelings and problems."
17470,7,1,1,"she is responsible . she has to do all these things such as  school, work, then home to make dinner. shes overworked"
17471,7,1,1,"One trait that describes rose is hard-working. I chose this word because she not only goes to school,but she also works."
17472,7,0,0,Rose is slightly bitter. A supporting fact is when she was talking to Anna after she had a bad dream. She tried to laugh but it sounded fake even to her.
17473,7,2,2,"Rose is a thoughtful person, she doesn't answer her Aunt Kolab so that she doesn't hurt her."
17474,7,1,1,Rose is a carring person; when her sister came into her room she took her down stairs and gave a glass of orange juice to calm her down.
17475,7,1,1,Rose is a the type of girl that wants to do anything possible to please everyone she knows. She wants to be known as dependable. The one detail that comes to my mind is when Rose is thinking about writing that essay eventhough she is very busy with working but she wants to win the prize.
17476,7,0,0,"Rose tries to hide how she really feels. When she talks to Anna, she tries to sound reassuring even though she is worried. For example, she tries 'a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'"

17479,7,0,0,Anna is very courageous. She doesn't mind working hard for the family even though it might hurt her. An example of this is how she works a four hour shift after school to bring in money to help pay for her brother's schooling.
17480,7,0,0,A trait that Rose can be described by is realistic.  She realizes the importance of her dad taking a job in Los Angeles because it pays three times more than what he was making.  She knows that the money will go to good use by putting his children through college.
17481,7,1,1,Hard-working; Rose understands that she and her family must work hard to get what they need in life. She works hard to help pay for her brother's college knowing that once he has finished school and gets a good job he will help pay for her college. In paragraph 11 she states this.
17482,7,1,1,"Rose is very considerate. Although she probably resents that her father must get a job in Los Angeles, she understands the greater goal behind his reasoning and tries to explain it to Anna. She knows that all of her family members need to help each other succeed."

After school she goes to work, then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner. When all of this is done she finally has her own time to work on homework. All of this is to help her family. Aunt Kolab asks if she is weighted down by all of this work. She doesn't answer truthfully, so they don't know how hard all of it is on her. She puts her family first in everything she does."
17620,7,2,2,Rose is compassionate. This is easy enough to tell from her reaction when Anna walked into the room. Rose immediately took in her sister's body language and asked her what was wrong. She then proceded to try and comfort her sister throughout the conversation by explaining why their parents and others chose to do as they have done.
17621,7,0,0,"Based on the story I read, patience is a trait that can be used to describe Rose. Although she has a heavy load on her shoulders, she does not take her stress out on others. When her sister came into her room she calmly asked her if she was okay. Rose was there for her sister and had a civil conversation with her Aunt despite all of the stress she was feeling. Rose is a patient person."

17676,7,2,2,"One trait that best describes Rose is responsiable. Rose show a great deal of responsablity because she is dealing with a lot to help support her family at such a young age and when he little sister begins to feel tired of the situation, as does Rose.

17727,7,1,1,"Based on her conversation with Anna, the reader can conclude that Rose is a strong person. For the sake of her younger sister, she puts on a brave attitude and sincerely assures her sister that all the promblems and conflicts within the family will soon be ressolved. We know that Rose works very hard in everything that she does, mainly for the sake of her family.       In the begining of the story, we read that Rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class, do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family. However, when she is having her conversation with Anna, Rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister. This suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story. I believe that this little action shows that Rose is a strong and hearfelt person."

She knows that Paul getting a good job and paying for both herself and Anna to go to college is basically impossible, but she wants to believe it's true so she doesn't have to worry so much.  One detail to support this would be the when Rose cupped her hands and though about how hard it must be for Paul to have all of that pressure on his shoulders."
17735,7,0,0,"Rose is strong. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, she is careful because she doesn't want to reveal to her aunt that she is exhausted from working and going to school.

But she does this with a good heart."
17736,7,2,2,"Rose is dedicated, but feels pinned down. Shes wishes for alone time and free time, but knows she has the duty of helping her family.

Instead of voicing her doubts, she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation."

During her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt, and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on Rose. Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is."
17743,7,1,1,"'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'      This statement shows that Rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesn't want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping. Aunt Kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to Rose.

17797,7,1,1,"Rose is helpful, because she helps her aunt make dinner."
17798,7,1,1,"Based on her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose seems to be quite understanding. When Anna complains to Rose about their father being away Rose takes the time to explain to Anna why it is their father is in that situation.

17804,7,2,2,I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'

17812,7,1,1,"Rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to Anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to Aunt Kolab for fear of hurting her.

17988,7,1,1,Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things.

18006,7,2,2,"One treat that can describe Rose would be positivety.  During her conversation with Anna, Rose told her that they have their part to do to help Paul finish college, then he'll get a good job and that he'll pay for Anna and her to go to college.

Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.

I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt."
18017,7,0,0,One trait that can describe Rose is stress. Why I say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time.

'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal,' Rose's aunt said to Rose near the end of the passage.

18065,7,0,0,"I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her.

18085,7,2,2,"Rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister. In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna's hopes up. Her sister probably looks up to Rose so she needs to seem confident, so Anna won't lose confidence. But when talking to her Aunt, she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go. Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose. And Rose helps Anna. And together, they can help each other have faith."

We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed.

18133,7,2,2,"Even though Rose has a lot going on in her life, she still takes the time to be caring for her sister. When Anna has a bad dream, Rose says, ''What's wrong? You feel okay?'' When Anna is feeling down, Rose tries to lighten the situation by saying, ''It's only been four months.'' This clearly shows that Rose is caring."
18134,7,2,2,"One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet.

18142,7,2,2,Rose is a very posistive individual. The way that she keeps up a happy appearance when she is talking to her little sister proves this statement. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'

18145,7,0,0,"Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother."
18146,7,1,1,I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.

Rose was given so much responsibility and it is weighing down on her, but she keeps striving to make things right."
18155,7,0,0,She feels all tied up with life. Trying to do everything she can to stay on track. Staying up late working on school work to get in finished for the next day.
18156,7,2,2,"Rose is very caring. She is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young.

18160,7,0,0,Rose feels like she has alot of stress on her to complete duty that have to be done. She said ' her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion.' That lets the readers know shes dealing with stress that has her overwhelmed.
18161,7,1,2,"Rose has an over-developed sense of responsibility as she is pressured to work herself into exhaustion to help support her brother.  She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible."
18162,7,2,2,When Rose is speaking with Anna Rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage.

18167,7,2,2,"Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working."
18168,7,0,0,"I'm not sure if being depressed is a trait, but I feel like Rose is very stressed out. When her sister tells her that she had a bad dream Rose completely ignore her. I believe that Rose wasn't ignoring her on purpose, but had her mind on a million things, and couldn't focus."
18169,7,2,2,"During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait."
18170,7,1,1,One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.
18171,7,0,0,Rose feels over-worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself. She feels like she has no time to do anything. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?' (par.3 sent.1)

18176,7,0,0,she is lonely

18179,7,0,0,The trait that I think Rose on her conversations is she should be more like Anna cause Rose thinks more like Anna and then Rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy.
18180,7,0,0,"One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister and aunt would be Conflicted.

18183,7,2,1,"In her conversation with Anna, the reader can see that Rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family, specifically her brother. However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels."
18184,7,0,0,She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.

18190,7,2,1,Rose is caring and helpful because she tries so hard to help the family out and her aunt even said that it must be hard on her.
18191,7,0,0,Rose is quite mature for her age.

Even if that does mean that she cant always do what she wants to."

18369,7,0,1,"Rose has taken on a adultlike responsibility. This is evident when Anna says to her, 'You sound just like mama.' This trait could be described as she was growing up too fast. she was not the typical teen that people would think of in the world. The best example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like. This shows that she is busy with helping. This fact is shown when she talks to her aunt in the end when it talks about her being weighed down because she is helping her family."
18370,7,1,1,Rose wants to help her family out because of the hard time they are going through. She is what you call it a 'people pleaser' and she wants to help out and win the essay contest to help out her family.
18371,7,2,2,"Rose is considerate. She is stressed out and feels like there is too much responsibility on her, but knows the family needs help. When Aunt Kolab asks her if she felt weighted down by helping the family, she doesn't respond because she wants to help, she just doesnt know how much she can."

18373,7,0,0,"Rose feels overwhelmed with all of her responsibilites; however, she is very understanding about what she needs to do to help her family. She displays this understanding attribute when she cups her hands and thinks to herself that her brother's fate lies partly in her hands."
18374,7,0,0,"Resourceful, Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague."
18375,7,1,1,"I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working."
18376,7,2,2,"Rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night, she immediately asked if anything was alright."
18377,7,0,0,Guilty would describe Rose because in paragraph 19 Rose was afraid to tell Aunt Kolab because the dosen't want to hurt her aunt and she also thought that her aunt would tell her mother so Rose just kept it to herself.
18378,7,1,1,"Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork."

18384,7,1,1,"Rose is very hardworking. This is demonstrated by the fact that she works a job in addition to her schoolwork, and also competes in other areas, like the essay-writing contest. Teh fact that she can manage all of those activities at all, even if they do leave her exhausted, is proof of her hardworking character."
18385,7,0,0,There is one trait that can be picked up from the two conversations in the story. Rose wants to help her Mom and her Aunt but she has alot on her mind. For instance when she was talking about writting the essay and she said'when woud she have time to write a flawless three thousand word essay.'
18386,7,0,0,She is willing to heklp her brother work his way to college. She tries her best to do what she can.

18393,7,1,1,Rose is a very busy person.It said that her aunt' offer had somehow made her feel lighter. It made the weight on her shoulders lighten up a bit.
18394,7,1,0,"One way to describe Rose would be respectful, because through out the whole story Rose never talks back to Aunt Kolab."
18395,7,0,0,"One trait I can think of would be unsure of herself. She seems to be unsure if she can help out her family like the others. like she questions whether or not she is capable.She feels as though she would be a let down if she was not able to help out. One detail would be when her aunt ask her ' Do you feel so weighed down by waht you're doing to help this family?', she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt."
18396,7,0,0,"I think that Rose is Open Minded. Because She could be like her sister and be bitter and angery but, even when she talks to her aunt and sister she still concidered about her family because her sister at the table is telling her there's no hope for their family."
18397,7,0,0,"With Rose having school, work, chores, and homework I would say that she is strong. Rose has a converstation with Anna talikng about their papa and even though Rose doesnt like the situation any better, she trys to stay positive."
18398,7,0,0,"In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation."
18399,7,1,1,"As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character."

18405,7,0,0,"From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling."
18406,7,0,0,"The trait is that Rose kept an 'Open Mind' during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay, which pretty much worked out in the long run."
18407,7,0,0,"In both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress. Rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work. Rosa feels,' that she is too young for so much responsibility.'"

18409,7,2,2,"'Anna,' Rose said 'Whats wrong?' You feel okay?' It shows that she is caring"
18410,7,1,1,One trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab could be that she is a very family person she wishes to make people happy and try her best to keep the family togather.
18411,7,2,2,"Rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else. In her conversation with her little sister Anna, Rose feels overwelmed but she doesn't let her sister know and she even tries to compfort her.

18412,7,0,0,"Rose was cautious. She didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her. One passage in the story that would support this conclusion is, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'"
18413,7,2,2,One trait Rose shows is caring. The reader can see this in the 19th  paragraph because Rose doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings.

This must be difficut for you. Yes?' This quote shows how Rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes, and had to have Rose point it out to her. The eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture, but she was seeing differently."
18420,7,2,2,"Rose can be described as consoling.  In her conversation with Anna, Rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to Anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation.  She justifies their helping Paul with college, by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job.  Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood."

18424,7,2,2,"Rose, while feeling overwhelmed, tried to be optimistic in most situations. She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna. If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue."
18425,7,0,0,"Rosa coul be feeling a little hust at the dream she had. She told Anna that 'I'm fine, I just had another bad dream.'"
18426,7,0,0,"In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family."
18427,7,0,0,"Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way."
18428,7,2,2,One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'

18439,7,0,0,"From paragraph 19 I could tell that Rose is a very modest person. I got the feeling that she doesn't like to bother people. She even says 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone."

18443,7,0,0,"She is very self-sufficient. While conversing with Aunt Kolab, she was very weary about letting her true feeling show. Aunt Kolab thought up the meaning of Rose's dream and asked if Rose felt that way. Of course Rose, not wanting any help or pity, avoided expressing her true emotions."

18446,7,2,2,"One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined. She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'"
18447,7,2,2,"Rose is hopeful because during her conversation with Anna, she would say how when Paul gets a good job after college he would pay for her and Anna to go to college too."
18448,7,2,2,Rose seems very caring and always think about others. She is so worried about helping her brother go to college.
18449,7,1,1,Rose is a young girl having to squeeze in time for her school work while she has a job and also a younger sibling to take care of. Even though she had many things to do she still is caring for her family and is willing to do it all for them.

18451,7,2,2,"One trait of Rose's that was shown in her coversation with Aunt Kolab hit me like a speeding bullet. Respect. Rose has respect for her aunt and her family. She knew the answer to Aunt Kolab's question, but felt that she would hurt her aunt so she decided it was better to say nothing than something wrong."

18453,7,0,0,Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.
18454,7,1,1,"One trait that discribes Rose is loyalty.  Even with her hectic schedule, Rose is loyal to her family`s needs.

Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need."
18455,7,0,0,"Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her."

18458,7,0,0,"Anna is a very realistic person, and that is a good trait to have. She could easily be mad at her father for leaving her, but she realizes that their family needs the money, so she accepts why he left. Anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life. She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is."

18463,7,0,0,ROSE DIDNT ANSWER
18464,7,0,0,Rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much. She did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother.
18465,7,1,1,"I believe that one trait about Rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. In the story she mentions that she goes straight to school, then to work, home to cook dinner with her aunt, then does homework for the rest of the night, so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it."
18466,7,0,0,"One trait that I saw was that she acts different around different family members, for example, she was talking a bit more with her sister than she did with her aunt."
18467,7,0,0,Rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times. She said. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' When in reality he was gone for four months. Which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1.
18468,7,0,0,"She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt."
18469,7,0,0,Well it was that time in the kitchen that can desribe Rose how she stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
18470,7,1,2,I think that Rose is mature. I think this because in the story she tries to help her sister with how she is feeling. Rose tries to help Anna out with the leaving of their father.
18471,7,1,1,"Based on the conversation between Rose and Anna, I believe that Rose is protective. In paragraph 11, Rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It seems like Rose is trying to comfort Anna, without revealing what she truly feels. By covering up her feelings while speaking to Anna, I believe Rose is being protective and trying not to expose Anna to the way she really feels about her Papa's absence."
18472,7,1,1,"Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.  Anna tells Rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working."
18473,7,0,0,"Rose is very shy, but also likes to get what she wants. She likes things to be her way. In the story Aunt Kolab says 'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.'"
18474,7,2,2,"Rose is very respectfull of her elders. When she was speaking with her Aunt Kolab about how she felt weighed down by the responsibilities put on her, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother."
18475,7,1,1,"Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while. Rose feels similarly about the burden of supporting their brother. She chooses to say that everything will work out to try and support her sister instead of letting her know her actual thoughts."
18476,7,0,0,"Stressful. When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay? 'I'm insane,' she said grimly as she gathered books and papers."
18477,7,0,0,She wants to be succesful. She says when she is talking to Anna she says 'Only if you have everything.' And how she says about traveling to Sacramento to recieve a prize.
18478,7,1,1,Rose is kind of quiet. She is helpful but doesn't really say anything. Like when Rose and Aunt Kolab were talking she just nodded and didn't say much.
18479,7,0,0,"She is very ambituos. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time for homework.'"

18482,7,0,0,"Rose is stressed out. She is in high school, and has to work everyday. She has too many things going on at one time. Her boss might fire her if she misses another day of work. She tries to stay positive, but it is really hard for her to because of the tremendous amount of stress on her."
18483,7,1,1,"When talking with her sister Anna, Rose acts very compassionately. Rose tries to act kindly towards Anna, and she does not want the younger girl to feel upset about the family's situation. After Rose admits that she misses Papa, Rose tries to rationalize the situation; she gently explains that he had to go to another job in order to support their family. By saying this, Rose attempts to make her sister feel less upset. Thus, Rose is quite compassionate."
18484,7,1,1,"Rose is a very caring daughter that just misses her father because, he is working in Las Angeles."
18485,7,0,0,Rose is a teenage girl who takes on a lot of responsibility. She is a student and is trying to write a three-thousand word essay on top of trying to fulfill her duty at her job.
18486,7,1,1,"Rose is very thoughtful towards others. She really only thinks about the ones around her and how she can help them. She tells Anna that her father will pay for them to go to college, so she is making her sister feel better saying that her father will take care of them and do the best he can."

18587,7,2,2,1) I belive that Rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with Anna. She comforted Anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice.

18589,7,0,0,"Rose is very close-minded.

18596,7,0,0,"When she is quiet, she seems self concious."
18597,7,0,0,Rose come's off to be a an impatient person. Its not her sister's fault that she has to write such a long essay. She gets an attitude with her sister. 'Her voice sank to a fierce whisper.'
18598,7,0,0,"One trait is the fact that she doesn't want to hurt her family, no matter the reason, so she decides to lie. In paragraph 19 she puts this theory into effect."

18602,7,0,0,I believe that Rose had the trait to endure. Not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay. She also has the patients to endure even the negative moments that her sister often feels due to the situation they are in.
18603,7,0,0,"Rose doesn't think that her life will never get alittle easier. Unless her parents and her aunt had someway to make her feel lighter then always being busy. 'Camdodian tradition and snese of family, she realized, could survive an ocean corssing''."

18605,7,1,1,"Rose seems like she does alot to help her family, and it is hard on her because shes still young. She's a strong person, and would most likely do everything she could to help her family. Rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt, and now she feels like things might get easier."
18606,7,1,1,"Rose, the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down-to-earth. While many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics, some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time. An example of Rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister. Instead of comforting Anna when she talked about missing thier father, Rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college."
18607,7,0,0,"Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head."
18608,7,2,2,"One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything.

She says that she misses him and says money isn't everything because that's why he went to get more money for the family. Rose doesn't understand that so she is very upset about him leaving.
18610,7,2,2,Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18611,7,0,0,I think that Rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do. Like in the story her Aunt said 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?' Rose nodded. that rite there is what tells me that Rose feels responsible..
18612,7,0,0,"She feels stressed, like she can't do what she wants to do. She feels as though she must do what is best for the family, therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest. An example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy, but having to travel to sacramento.

18616,7,1,1,"To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay."
18617,7,0,0,"She worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now. She talked to Anna about they had a part to do, so that they could go to college. Aunt Kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do. Rose said that she does worry about it."
18618,7,0,0,"she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around. because how she said, 'I hate how late she has to work' and also when she said im so lonesome for Papa'"
18619,7,0,0,"One trait that can describe Rosa based on her converstions with Aunt Kolab is exausted because she has alot on her shoulders between working, school, and other activities such as the three thousand word essay for a competition."
18620,7,0,0,"Rose has identified her self as stressed. Durring both conversations, Rose seems to be hiding it. When Rose's aunt began speaking she noticed Rose's face. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'"
18621,7,1,1,"Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true."
18622,7,1,1,"Rose is a loving, caring and very family orientated."

18625,7,2,2,"In the story Crossing Over, the character Rose is very hard working. When Rose is talking to her younger sister Anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay. Another thing Rose says while talking to her sister is that we have to do our part to help Paul, the older brother, finish college. Later in the story she is talking to her aunt, and her aunt says to her do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family. These example show that Rose is a very hard worker."
18626,7,2,2,"She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab. She knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question, so she did not say anything."
18627,7,0,0,"She feels like she isn't ready to have someone else's fate in her hands.  when she talked to Aunt Kolab, she didn't talk, but she did agree that she felt weighted down by all the responsobility, and soon after was grateful that she had talked about it."
18628,7,1,1,Rose worries alot.
18629,7,0,0,I brlieve that Rose is sad. She is moping around. She is having nightmares. She feels like the wolrd is resting on her shoulders.
18630,7,1,0,I believe strength describes Rose. She is trying to hold her family together and we see this during her conversation with Anna.
18631,7,0,0,Rose is strong. Even though she has to work at the restaurant and go to school she tries to push forward for her family.
18632,7,0,0,"From reading the passage, one of Rose's traits would probably be confusion or exhaustion from the essay."

18635,7,2,2,"Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night."
18636,7,2,1,"Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better. She makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything. Rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does. An example of this is when she tells Anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future."
18637,7,1,1,"She's caring by listening to her sister and trying to cheer her up, even though she failed at it, and also thinks about her aunt and her home country of Cambodia as something to write for her essay."

18641,7,0,0,When Rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money.

They both understand that the family needs money. Her Aunt says that it was the same way in the other country. They both have the same trait just different arguments.
18642,7,0,0,"Rose is very humble. At first, Rose dislikes all the responsibility that is put on her. Then she realizes that Paul has the fate of two people in his hands. Rose only has to take care of herself for now. She appreciates the fact that Paul will care for her and her sister."

18645,7,1,1,Rose seems very caring. When her sister Anna wakes up and she is talking to Rose about how their dad had to go to Los Angeles for a job and Rose comforted Anna even though she was upset as well.
18646,7,1,1,Rose cares about her family more than anything.
18647,7,0,0,One trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there. I think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing. Her mom works late and so that must mean that Rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time.
18648,7,0,0,Rose is a lonely person.
18649,7,2,2,"Rose cares for her family, not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt.  She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away."
18650,7,0,0,"Rose feels as if she has to work, work, work to help her family. It seems she can't enjoy herself or write her essay. In the story it says 'pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom', Rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her."

18656,7,1,2,"One trait that describes Rose is hopeful. Even though she has to work, go to school, cook, and try to write an essay, she still has hope that her life is going to get better. This is shown when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.'

Also, Paul has recieved his diploma and so she may feel pressured to reach up at education just as he did but the essay unresolved burdens her mind."
18660,7,0,0,"Rose is very difiant in the story. It's almost like she is looking for attention.

18661,7,2,2,"Rose is a very understanding person. She understands that in order to live a life somewhere new, there will be changes that they all will have to make. She knows that they cannot all have everything they want, but in order to have somethings, they have to make some sacrifices.     While Rose is talking with Anna she explains to her that Their father getting a job in Los Angeles was something he had to do for their family.

18663,7,0,0,Rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change.
18664,7,2,2,"One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is a grateful person. When Aunt Kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell, Rose felt better. In Crossing Over, it says, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.' That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out."
18665,7,0,0,"Rose is responsibility, because She said, 'she felt too young for so much respnsibilt'."
18666,7,2,2,One of Rose's main traits in the story is her selfless determination. When she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul pay for college...' she shows how helpful she is to her brother.
18667,7,1,1,"She is hardworking, because she balances schoolwork and works a 4-hour shift at her job."
18668,7,0,0,"Rose is shy. Rose shows this when she is talking to Anna. Rose does not say much, but finally looses patience with Anna. Also, when Rose talks to Aunt Kolab she does not say much either just keeping her thoughts to herself and nodding."
18669,7,2,2,"One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. After Anna's bad dream, Rose tries to help Anna see their father moving away as a positive thing. Rose also attempts to help Anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job."

She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first."
18671,7,1,2,"Rose is a very responsible and respectful person. In paragraph 2 she was responsible for supporting her family, working, and doing school work. Rose is very respectful to her Aunt Kolab because as it shows in paragraph 12 sshe does not want to hurt her."
18672,7,1,1,"Based on the conversation with Anna, you can tell Rose is sincere. She hid her true feelings in order to try to comfort her little sister."
18673,7,0,0,"Rose is careless of others.in her conversation with Anna she was talking as if money were everything, and she was rolling her eyes at Anna.Rose said they have to do their part and help Paul through college, so he will pay for them to go to college when it's their turn to go."

18675,7,2,2,"Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family."
18676,7,2,2,"In the passage Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  She says this to her little sister Anna, as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money.  This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic.

18677,7,2,2,"I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings. She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes.'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt."
18678,7,0,0,Anna
18679,7,0,0,Rose is selfish. In the story when Rose and Anna were talking Rose was saying how there Papa was away in Las Angelas for 4 months but she really didn't care cause the job payed better. Anna got upset and said money wasn't everything to her.
18680,7,0,0,"She feels like everything is hard for her, her essay, her job, moving from a different country, it would be hard for her.

18681,7,0,0,Rose
18682,7,0,0,"Rosa feels like her brother is bringing her down, she also feels like she is responsible for her brother in a way.  A part in the story is when she says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these' , she talking about her hands.  She is saying that she is going to have to work for him so they can have a good life."
18683,7,0,0,Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.
18684,7,0,0,Rose is uptight.  This is apparent when she dreams of Paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family.
18685,7,2,2,"Thoughtful. When Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her Mother's feelings if she had answered the question. Also, Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away."
18686,7,1,1,Rose is loving and cares for her familybut she is scared and lonely. Rose is scared f being lonely and misses her family very much. Rose expresses her feelings of loneliness.
18687,7,0,0,Rose had a essay to write and she was getting a additude with them all rolling her eyes throughing the chair and more. she wanted to stay with her aunt Kolab.and her aunts face lit up because she wanted her niece to stay with her and start over.
18688,7,1,1,"Rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than Anna and realistic about thier situation. I know this because when Anna says money isn't everything, she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything."
18689,7,0,0,"ROSE IS DOUBTFUL, ESPECIALLY BY HER SARCASTIC REMARKS TOWARD,HER SISTER, ANNA SAYING,'ONLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING.'"
18690,7,0,0,"Rose she has a lot on her plate. She has to work and go to school plus has to watch her sister Anna, Plus Rose seems to be a dreamer , she has a lot of bad dreams everything is hard for both her and Anna."
18691,7,2,2,Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab. She shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt.
18692,7,2,2,One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings. I think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down Rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her.
18693,7,0,0,"Rose seems to be reserved. She's more to herself, she won't talk about her feelings to others. At the end of the story, Aunt Kolab was asking Rose about how she felt about the family. She asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' Rose didn't answer to her Aunt Kolab she just simply nodded."
18694,7,1,1,"Thoughtful because, she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she didnt want to hurt her mother."

18698,7,0,0,A TRAIT THAT ROSE HAS IS THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS HER PROBLEMS AND TO REASSURE OTHERS.
18699,7,0,0,She is very stressed. When Rose talks to Anna about working on the essay so hard that she fell asleep doing it.
18700,7,2,1,"In the conversations that Rose has with Anna and Aunt Kolab Rose comes off as determined. She is determined to graduate just like her brother, Paul, did. She's determined to help her family out as much as possible with her father gone in Los Angeles."
18701,7,0,0,"She is a very busy person in the story.  She is constantlydoing something to help, wether it be school or family.  'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to hel Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.' (Paragraph 2)."
18702,7,1,1,Rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger.
18703,7,1,1,"She is caring and wants to be as kind as possible. An example was when the story said, 'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.' She was obviously trying to be nice to her sister."
18704,7,0,0,A trait that Rose showed when she was talking to Anna was that she can be sarcastic. She shows that when Anna said 'Money isn't everything' and Rose responded with 'Only if you already have everything'.
18705,7,2,2,"Rose is caring, when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family. Does not tell her that she is. She does this to save her aunt's and mother's feeling so they are not dissapointed in her."

18707,7,0,0,She is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
18708,7,1,1,"One trait that Rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people. She is very stressed concerning her family's situation, yet she still manages to keep going. Her talks with Aunt Kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has. Thus, she finds a topic for her essay, making her feel better."
18709,7,0,0,"One trait that describes Rose would be stressed. In the story she has to work at a resturant, help her aunt with supper, and do homework. The story also tells me that she would have to 'squeeze' in writing a paper. Telling me that she is pushed for time. Showing that she is stressed."
18710,7,2,1,Determined because she just knows that Paul will finish college and make enough money so that both of the girls will also be able to go to college.  Even though Anna doesn't think that this will happen Rose knows it will happen.
18711,7,0,0,Rosa told her Aunt Kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it. Her aunt understood completly and trird to help Rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help Rose not feel this way.
18712,7,1,1,"I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker."
18713,7,0,0,"I think Rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy. Rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility. But instead of going into how hard her life is, she notes on how much harder Paul's life was. This also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others."
18714,7,0,0,What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation. I think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things. In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differntly.....' I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
18715,7,0,0,One trait Rose has in this passage was that she said that ''Money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till Papa gets back from his job in Los Angeles.
18716,7,1,1,"One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out."
18717,7,2,2,"A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose."
18718,7,2,2,"One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do. It's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her. Although she is still young, she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker."
18719,7,0,0,"Rose felt that she did a lot for the family. She felt too stressed. Rose did a lot. she balanced having a job, school, helping take care of her sister and family.  She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level."
18720,7,0,0,"-she was sincere, one way this is shown in the story is, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'."
18721,7,0,0,"Rose has a sense of humor. She says, 'Only if you already have everything,' to express this humor although she does not feel like the happiness behind it is real."
18722,7,0,0,"She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner."
18723,7,1,1,Rose can be described as selfless. She puts the needs of her family first. She risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family. Her Aunt Kolab hints at it when she asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but Rose doesnt respond.
18724,7,1,1,One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
18725,7,0,0,Rose can quickly see the better things that can come out of the situations she is living in. This shows that Rose has a good attitude on life and when she is down she can become happy very quickly.
18726,7,1,1,"I think Rose is very caring.  It seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family, even though it can be very stressful at times.  I think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed."
18727,7,2,2,"She is considerate. Paragraph 19- Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would  hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother."
18728,7,1,1,Shes a caring person.
18729,7,0,1,"Rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by saying how she feels.  She didn't want to hurt her sister or her aunt. In the story, it says; Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother."
18730,7,2,2,"Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family. The storys states that she has a job, tries hard in school, and tries to help her sister as much as she can. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out."
18731,7,0,0,thinks she knows everything.she ignores anna.
18732,7,0,0,"Rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college. Rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep. This shows that Rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake, but her mother was not awake to help so Rose continued to keep to herself."
18733,7,2,2,"Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better."
18734,7,1,1,"She is hard working,' From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it waws time to do homework.'"
18735,7,2,2,"Rose is dedicated to her family.  This is proven by her conversation with Anna when she says that she and her father have to work for Paul to go through school.

Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present. Paul decided that because Mr. Leonard had helped him with track that he needed to help Mr. Leonard out with his reading. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'"
19954,8,2,1,The background information about Mr. Leonard relates to paul because they both couldnt read very good and mr. Leonard wants paul to to do better in life then what he did. it effects paul by making him want to try hard in track and school.

19957,8,1,1,"The information has an effect on Paul because Paul and Mr. Leonard both have the same problem with reading. Mr. Leonard was helping Paul excel at something, so now Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard. That's how the background information had an effect on both Paul and Mr. Leonard."
19958,8,2,2,"As Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard, he is able to see just how much alike the two of them really are. An example would be, Paul cannot read and neither can Mr. Leonard. When he was in college, Mr. Leonard was a star hurdler as a freshman; Paul is starting out to have potential to be a great hurdler. The last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are. Paul can  sympathsize with Mr. Leonard because they are both not very good at something."
19959,8,0,0,"The effect on Paul about Mr. Leonard was that it don't matter how smart you have to play sports, but it's best that you still care for your school!"
19960,8,2,2,"It shows that even if you cant read, just like Mr. Leonard, it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life. Just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldn't read, that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field. So it just showed Paul that he shouldn't give up just because something gets hard in life."
19961,8,1,1,He relates to Mr. Leonard. So feels bad for him.
19962,8,0,0,He starts to realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to teach him a life lesson on never giving up because he was a good athelete and ended up not being able to run because he couldn't read. He then realized he needed to learn to read and try his best to achieve his own greatness.

19964,8,2,2,Mr. Leonard isnt a good reader and so he tells paul he broke records in college but he couldnt read that good so it helped paul understand that it is good to learn how to read and over come obsticables
19965,8,2,2,"In knowing Mr. Leonard's background information, Paul feels like the two can relate now. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his inability to read, Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'

19966,8,2,2,"The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he was a track star through high school and his freshman year in college, but that he didn't know how to read. His grades were terrible and he flunked out of college despite being an incredible runner, it didn't help him academically. One of the best runners in history who broke records had more in common with Paul than he could have ever imagined. Paragraph 45 states, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could for him.' Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard also cannot read but took his time out of his day to teach Paul how to excel at something that he did know how to do, and knew how to do it very well. Paul returns this favor to the best of his ability by trying to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paragraph 46 says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, I said, walking back toward the school. It's time to start your training.'"
19967,8,2,2,"The backrground information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on him.  When he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but did not finish college it gave Paul hope.  He realized why Mr. Leonard was so interested in helping him better himself.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel, and feel like he was worth something.  So Paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return.  So he began teaching Mr. Leonard how to read."

This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' After he learns this about Mr. Leonard he realizes he should do something for him in return.

This feeling was the way he felt when he was in fromt of other students and wasn't sure of an answer or couldn't read a passage.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' supports the my opinion that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels.  The effect of Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul choose to help Mr. Leonard in reading, just as he had helped Paul overcome the obstacle of jumpin hurdles.  This is shown in this passage from the story, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.  Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'"
19974,8,1,1,The effection the data has on Paul is a lot. Paul thinks it is amazing that Mr. Leonard has done so much with his sports career.
19975,8,0,0,When Paul gets some background information on Mr. Leonard he finds out that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He also found out that he broke records. When Paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it Mr. Leonard told him that school was hard for him and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him. So that is just what he does about it.
19976,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college. He was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip. paul became an amazing athlete  who can't read as well.

19977,8,2,2,"The information Paul finds about Mr. Leonard on the website is surprising to him.  He found out that Mr. Leonard also had, and still does, trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read.       Paul finds this to be surprising.  He feels empowered to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read, since Mr. Leonard has helped him learn to jump hurdles and get pass obstacles, like not being able to read very well or at all."
19978,8,2,2,"It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that Paul has in life.  He emotionally talks about how he had gone to college on a track and field scholarship but flunked out because he couldn't read, and that really affected Paul because he knew that feeling all too well. Paul was having to go to a learning center to read so he knew exactly what Mr. Leonard went through."
19979,8,1,1,"At first Paul felt a little big left out because in paragraph 35, he said 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'. After some of the story is revealed, Paul became curious and pressed on in paragraph 40 'Well, what happened after that?'. Then finally in paragraph 46, when the full story is told, Paul felt bad for Mr.Leonard because the two people are very alike."
19980,8,0,2,The backgound information that PAul had gotten effect him because Mr.Lenard couldn't read just like him so they both help out each other to learn something new.
19981,8,1,0,The effect of the background information had a great effect on Paul. Paul might have felt as though he is being trained by one of the best hurdlers he knows of. Paul was also appauled by the information he wanted to know why Mr. Leonard stopped doing track and why did he want to trained Paul.
19982,8,1,1,Paul is surprised by what he finds out about Mr. Leonard. He was kind of shocked and excited about the achivements that he had made.
19983,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard was a very good track runner. He broke lots of records while he ran the hurdles. He was a poor reader and lost all his scholarships and flunked out of college. He now works as a hall monitor. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read and Mr. Leonard is going to help Paul run track.
19984,8,2,2,Learning about Mr. Leonard's background information gives Paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer. Paul empathizes with Mr. Leonard because he understands the embarrassment Mr. Leonard feels due to his inability to read since he himself has gone through the same experience. Paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort Mr. Leonard has given to help him.  He shows this thankfulness with his desire to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.

19987,8,0,0,it makes him think vwerry different about Mr. leonerd because he was not the guy he was thought out to be.
19988,8,2,2,He was a good athlete but he wasnt such a good student. Mr.Leonard relied on his friends to help him get by. He related to him because he was embarrased when he got called to read aloud. It doesnt really effect the back ground so much
19989,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was ashamed although he did well in his athletics he wasnt a good student . and he wanted Paul to know that you cant get by easy without knowing you work. He wanted Paul to focus on learning but at the wsame time become a better athlete. Mr. Leonard tell Paul how and what he did and college, and that was depend on others to help him get by."
19990,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard try to be good person and he want to go to collage but Mr.Leonard felt embarrassment.
19991,8,2,2,The background information helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard. Neither of them can read and they are both good at sports.
19992,8,2,2,"After Paul finds out the background information on Mr.Leonard he is curious on why he is still not an athlete. He is also curious on why he didnt finish college. But just like Paul Mr. Leonard can not read. Paul can feel the emotions that Mr. Leonard is feeling. Paul knew them well because he knew what it felt like to be called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer like everyone else. Just like Mr.Leonard help Paul training in becoming a great fast runner, Paul is taking Mr.Leonard to the center learning center."
19993,8,0,2,"When someone gets background information on someone else, they learn alot more about that person. In the story, Paul is informed background information on Mr. Leonard. As it is discovered, the information is actually similar to what Paul has a problem with. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college cause his lack of ability to read. Although Mr. Leonard wasn't a very good reader, he was a very good runner. When Paul explains that he can't read, Mr. Leonard wants Paul to run track like Mr. Leonard did in high school. He wanted Paul to run so he could excel at something like Mr. Leonard did. They both had the same feelings of embarrassment for their lack of ability to read."
19994,8,2,2,"The effect it had on paul was to want to help Mr. Leonard with his reading ability.'Soon I realized what I could do for him.'C'mon,Mr. Leonared,'I said, walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'"
19995,8,2,2,"During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was an athlete who didn't go far due to his poor reading skills. This information, made Paul feel more comfortable because he became aware that Mr. Leonard had the same problem that he has. They're both good athletes who have trouble reading."
19996,8,0,0,They find alot out about eachother more and more while Mr.Leaonard is training Paul.
19997,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard couldn't read either and he's trying to say that everyone has obsticals they have to overcome in life. Reading is one of the things Mr. Leonard needed to overcome but he didn't overcome it while he was in college that's why he flunked out. No school wanted a runner that couldn't read so he never went back.
19998,8,2,2,"When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard's background it was all to familiar to Paul. Paul said in the story that he knew the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words to well, feelings of embarrassment when called to read aloud, or when he didn't know an answer everyone else did know."
19999,8,2,2,I think that when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard he is inspired to be just like him. Paul says 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' this shows that Paul is enthused about the fact that the person who taught him to do this is a professional in his eyes.
20000,8,2,2,"The effect it has on paul, is to motivating. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great track runner in college. Paul is motivated because Mr. Leonard had the same problems Paul is sturggling with."
20001,8,1,2,"The background information that was given in the story has an effect on Paul because Mr.Leonard sees himself in Paul. Mr.Leonard could not read in school, but was very good at track. He feels that Paul is going through the same thing. Paul feels that he can relate to Mr.Leonard. Now Mr.Leonard is going to try and help Paul complete what he could not."
20002,8,2,2,"When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed very suprised. He had no idea that Mr. Leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before. When he found out about this information, he was very empethetic. He said 'It's time to start your training.' in support for him."
20003,8,0,0,It shows that Paul will have a good coach to teach him how to do the hurdles. when Mr. Leonard is telling him to pump his arms and lean Paul will know that Mr. Leonard will know what he is talking about.
20004,8,0,0,"Paul knew nothing about Mr. Leonard before he started having conversations with him. The most Paul knew about him, was that Mr. Leonard was the hall monitor, and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis. When the coach gave Paul the URL and told him to do some research on Mr. Leonard, it had a great effect on him when he did it. He realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a 'hurdle' in his life and that he meant well. Mr. Leonard did this, hoping that Paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that Paul could overcome it while he still had a chance, and the ability to do so."
20005,8,2,2,The information made paul want to become a better athlete and reader. 'feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew.'(line 46-48) This shows how Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard after he told about his past.
20006,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard was talking to paul about when he use to be really good in sports until he lost everything; but paul new it was over.So Mr. Leonard is goin to help hem turn his life around so he can make a change not just doing good in sports but in school to.
20007,8,1,1,"The affect that Mr.Leonards story has on Paul is that, it shows him he can do something if he sets his mind to it, and he is trying to show him that he wants him to succed."
20008,8,2,2,"He finds out that Mr. Leonard is actually a track star, and he also can't read very well. In some ways they are very much alike, because Paul can't read very well either, but he is trained to be a great athlete. By finding out more about Mr. Leonard, Paul is able to compare himself to him in a 'role model' sort of way. Maybe with Mr. Leonard's help Paul will be inclined and encouraged to try and succeed in ways that Mr. Leonard couldn't."
20009,8,2,1,Paul felt like him and Mr leonard had stuff in common not knowing to read. He felt like he had to try his best and fulfill Mr. leonards tasks. Because when Mr. Leonard was in school he had the same problems as Paul and didnt make it cause he couldn't read like he did. So he was going to prove some people wrong and help Paul out in hurdle.
20010,8,2,2,He was suprised that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that even though he was a teacher he flunked ou of college.
20011,8,2,2,"When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused.  Then it is clear why Mr. Leonard took interest in Paul, and that is because he can relate to him.  Paul realizes this and connects them with a bond.  This bond is that neither of them can read well, and when Paul sees this, he decides to act, instead of being told what to do."
20012,8,2,2,Mr.Leonard had gone through the same thing as paul only he went throughhigh school then colege not knowing how to read then he finally flunked out of college and no other college wanted someone that couldnt read. paul was trying to learn how to read and now he had a reasoon to keep going and not give up.
20013,8,0,0,"Paul was effected because he has a problem reading just like Mr. Leonard, Which is why Paul was going to the learning center at the begining of the story. Paul didn't want to not learn how to read."
20014,8,1,2,Paul understood that working hard in school is still important even though it gets hard. The background information also shows Paul that he is almost like Mr. Leonard because he is becoming better at track and has trouble reading.
20015,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on Paul. It shows Paul that he is not alone with his reading problem. Also, that Mr. Leonard was a great runner but without education Mr. Leonard did not become sussccefull in life. It shows Paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life. Paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him. Like, at the end after learning Mr. Leonard's past and how he can't read. Paul offters to train him and help him read."
20016,8,2,2,"Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader just as Paul is. Paul now feels like he can accomplish great things if he works hard at them. Then, at the end he returns him a favor by helping Mr. Leonard become a better reader."
20017,8,0,0,He feels lied to.
20018,8,0,0,why do i have to take this test
20019,8,2,2,"Paul seemed shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner. But was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard never could read. I feel like Paul feels better knowing that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either, and that he wants to help Mr. Leonard out by teaching him how to read better. Just like Mr. Leonard did by helping him get on the track team. I think Paul found out at a good time, because I feel like that if Paul knew that from the beginning he would never actually try to learn to run with Mr. Leonard."
20020,8,1,2,"The information the coach provides Paul with enlightens and motivates him to make a better future for himself, and to make Mr. Leonard proud. Even though he is a weak reader, Paul finds that he is good at hurdles, something he and Mr. Leonard have in common. After Mr. Leonard shares his story, Paul is motivated to become a better reader, as well as to help Mr. Leonard to do so as well."
20021,8,2,2,"he is surprised that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college. He was suspicious, so he decide to ask Mr. Leonard. When he did, he found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read."
20022,8,0,0,"Its makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard quit running track and college, and when he asked Mr. Leonard why, Mr. Leonard said it was because he couldn't read that good. Also it helped Paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard use to be. Like a good athlete a good person but not the smartest."
20023,8,1,1,The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted to teach him how to jump hurdles and let him pass in the hallway when going to the learning center. Paul also now understands why Mr. Leonard didn't talk about his past and was so adamant to teaching Paul how to jump hurdles.
20024,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past, it changes his view of Mr. Leonard. He realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined. He even says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings too well, talking about the embarrassment of not being able to read. He also decides that it's his turn to help Mr. Leonard out, after everything that he's done for him. As it turns out, Mr. Leonard and Paul are two peas in a pod, and it changes Paul's view once he realizes it."
20025,8,2,2,when a coach hides something from you feel suspcious and want get in on the action. when he hid that secret about him quitting track because of his grades shocked the narrator.
20026,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard couldn't read and he wanted to make something of himself, just like Paul. Paul was getting tired of getting chose last for teams and not achieving, so he went ahead with Mr. Leonard's advise. Paul soon found out that Mr. Leonard was just like him and Paul wanted to achieve for Mr. Leonard."
20027,8,1,1,"The effects it has on Paul is to keep working hard, in school and out. No matter how good you are at the sport, you have to do well in school also. Paul took that advice, and started getting tutored and practicing on the track."
20028,8,1,1,"Paul finds out background information about Mr. Leonard when the high school track coach gave him a URL for a track and field website. This encouraged paul, because he could relate to Mr. Leonard. He also realized that he was dedicating his time to help Paul excel at something."
20029,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, he is suprised that Mr. Leonard had made such an achievement in his past. In return to Mr. Leonard helping him, Paul now wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since this is the reason he flunked out of college."
20030,8,2,1,"When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard had been an excellent runner in track, he is somewhat confused because, as the story says, Mr. Leonard is now only a hall monitor. He wonders what had happened that caused him to drop so low in the order of things. After he talks to Mr. Leonard though, he realizes that it is just as important to have a good education as it is to be good at sports. It inspires him to accel in all areas of his life, not just sports or school."
20031,8,1,1,I think it made Paul more motivated. I say that because Paul says ' this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. I think that made Paul feel special.
20032,8,2,2,Paul finds out that Mr. leonard is a poorp reader just like himself and I think Mr. leonard flunking out of college will push Paul to do better in reading.
20033,8,1,1,The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard makes him work harded at hurdles. Paul think's it is weird that Mr. Leonard flunked out of school.

He learned that he had to be determined no matter how discouraging the lack of reading skills truly is.

20064,8,0,0,"Well, Paul is doing really poor in school and Mr. Leonard was good at sports and bad at school to so he wants to make sure that Paul has at least something that he is good at so he shows him about track."
20065,8,0,0,"The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it causes him to wonder why Mr. Grabowski never continued his career as a runner. He wanted to know more because he asks, 'Well, what happened after that?'"

20070,8,0,0,"There is a lot of effect of Mr. Leonard's background information. One effect is that Paul did not feel as bad about not being able to read because Mr. Leonard was not very smart either.

It was like his obstacle in school when he didn't know how to read, but his friends helped him out through school and the learning center for Paul was like Mr. Leonards friends. But once he got to college his friends weren't there to help him out anymore. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to go onto college and make records and do what he wanted to do when he was in colloege but couldn't because he couldn't read and thats what made him drop out."
20073,8,2,2,Paul is proud that the man who has been coaching him is a great athlete himself but wonders why he never ran after his freshman year. He then wants to coach Mr. Leonard in reading like Mr. Leonard coached him in track.

20075,8,2,2,"Paul knew exactly how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing how to read. Paul felt the embarrassment he felt when he had read aloud infront of the class, or having to answer questions he didn't know the answer too."
20076,8,2,2,Mr. Leonard's background effects Paul because it realizes that he he is a lot like his self.  Mr. Leonard had reading problems when he was around Pauls age and he was usually picked last for sports.  That is when he found hurdles.
20077,8,1,1,It motivates him because they relate so much.
20078,8,2,2,"This information gives Paul a whole new view of Mr. Leonard. He sees a new man every time he looks at him because he never saw the track star in their school's hall monitor in the past. Now he sees something totally new, a new insight to Mr. Leonard's ideology, a new perspective from the man who got him started doing hurdles. The narrator's shock flows out of him when he asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him about his past. Then when Mr. Leonard explains why he dropped out of school, Paul is bewildered, but this gives him a new drive to do well in the learning center. This also gives him the idea of getting Mr. Leonard some help with the learning center. The information about his past spurs all of the reader's actions in the sequence of events that make up the falling action and resolution."
20079,8,0,0,Paul was a nervous person and he wanted to make his teacher and coach happy if he runs through the hurdles to get past the obsticles not just on the track but also about life too. He wanted get away from his fears so that he can move on with his personal life.
20080,8,2,2,He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either. He then wants to help Leonard because he had helped him with track.I found this out from the last two paragraphs of the story.
20081,8,1,2,"At first, Paul only thinks of Mr. Leonard as a hall monitor who checks his pass twice a week. Then, Mr. Leonard helps him seek an extracurricular activity, he is interested in and Paul doesn't quite understand why he is helping. After talking to the track coach, looks up Mr. Leonard on the internet, and talks to him about his past experience with track and learning, he then understands what he is trying to do for him. Mr. Leonard was in the same position as Paul and understand how he feels when it comes to school. So, he tries to find something that Paul will succeed in to help him build his confidence. After, Mr. Leonars helps him, Paul feels as if he should give back and help Mr. Leonard in return."

20084,8,0,0,makes him feel like he knows the person better since they have all that information about him.
20085,8,1,1,"Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student, not because he didn't try but because he couldn't read very well. Paul and Mr. Leonard are similiar because they are both good at hurdles but they had trouble reading. 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out.' He wanted Paul to be a good reader so that if he gets a scholarship for hurdles than he wouldn't lose it because of his grades."
20086,8,2,1,It helps moviate him to become a better reader and to try to help someone less forturnate.
20087,8,0,1,Paul was always the last one picked in gym. He then background checked Mr.Leonard and found that he was a track sta.That inspired him to get fit and to enjoy gym even to strive to be the first picked in gym. He also was wondering why Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past tack star statis and soon after the confrontation Mr.Leonard was inspired to re live his past as a track star.
20088,8,2,2,"Paul realized Mr. Leonard was like him in many ways.  He realized that although he couldn't read either, Mr. Leonard suceeded in a way.  Paul has the oppurtunity to do something Mr. Leonard couldn't, be a good athlete and learn to read.  Mr. Leonard didn't have learning centers, Paul realized how blessed he really was."
20089,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard was just like Paul at his age. He could not read. But then Mr. Leonard does what his former coaches did for him, and Paul taught Mr. Leonard how to read."
20090,8,0,0,The effect that background information Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that hes not very good at sports and is choosen last for teams. Mr. Leonard has also found out that Paul is not a very strong reader and goes to the Learning Center to get help on that.
20091,8,1,0,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past he is very thankful for the help on the track. He now knows that even though he cannot read as welll as some others, he is still very fast and can be one of the best thanks to Mr. Leonard's help."
20092,8,1,1,The background information that pauls recieves about Mr.Leonard has an effect on paul because it lets him know he can do anything he put his mind to even if he has weak points.

Mr.Leonard backround show his difficalty in reading just like Paul. Paul even states'The emotion in Mr.Leonard's words were all to familiar to me.'
20094,8,2,2,After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a great track star is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about running in college.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that he could not read and flunked out of college Paul knows how Mr. Leonard felt because he could not read at the beginning of the story.  After Paul hears Mr. Leonard tell him about his reading troubles he takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him for once learn how to accomplish something.
20095,8,2,0,He was kind of concerened why Mr. Leonard never mentioned that he was a great runner that broke records.
20096,8,0,0,The background information about Mr. Leonard are that Mr. Leonard broke records when he was a freshmen in college that won the 4oo meter hurdles at the nationals. He was not that good in school and only went to college cause he was a good athlete so he flunked out and didnt gradute. They didnt have learning places back then.
20097,8,1,1,It affected Paul because Mr.Leonard's story was almost the same as his and he could relate to the feelings of Mr. Leonard. Like being called on to answer a question and not knowing it.
20098,8,2,2,"After Paul finds out the background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard.  The teacher could not read when he was in high school either and did not get the best grades and he could not read.  Paul realizes that if he keeps working in the learning center and gets better at reading, and when he gets really good at track he could be in the same place Mr. Leonard was but farther.  Paul realizes that him and his coach could become very close because he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard was when he was his age and the coach wants to help him achieve and go very far."
20099,8,1,1,"Mr. Leoanrd's background taught Paul a valuable lesson on doing well academically and in sports. For example, Mr. Leonard words were familiar to Paul and they were feelings of embarrassment."
20100,8,2,2,The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard is encouraging to Paul. Paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help Mr. Leonard.  At the end of the story he walks back to the school telling Mr. Leonard that it's time to start his training. The background information of Mr. Leonard encourages Paul to help the hall monitor out.
20101,8,2,2,"Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student. He saw that Mr. Leonard achieved by training for the hurdles, but he didn't have enough courage to learn to read. He wanted to become something in life like Mr. Leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important. He also decided that Mr. Leonard did him a favor, so he will teach him how to read in return."
20102,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's story has a powerful effect on Paul.  It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles.  Many people have gone through what he is going through.  They had a lot in common.  Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability.  Paul is actually lucky.  When Mr. Leonard was in school, they didn't have learning centers to help people read.  Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received.      Paul looks at what he has been given and the time and effort Mr. Leonard has put into him and decides that he should give something back.  He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training' in reading."
20103,8,2,2,It makes him surprised and made him wonder why he wasn't still doing hurtles until he found out from Mr. Leonard that he couldn't read. The narrator was very impressed especially with him winning the 400 meter hurtles at the nationals and the fact that he broke records.
20104,8,1,1,When paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he was very surprized also he wondered what happend to him. He understude him because Paul also was not good in school.
20105,8,0,0,he finds out about his colledge track succes and wants to be like him.
20106,8,1,1,It has an effect on Paul becuse it sounds just like him. Paul cant read very well at all. He gets help which Mr. Leonard did not really have the chnce to get help from teachers only students. Paul want to exel in school and track. He wanted to over come his obsticals. The hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and Paul could over come them if he just trye. Paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school.
20107,8,1,1,"It makes Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to meet him in the gym at 2:30. It explains why Mr. Leonard cares anything at all about Paul, because he is a school hall monitor."
20108,8,0,1,paul is always getting picked last and so was leonard. they both cant read so they are just alike. and now they are both really good at jumping hurdles.
20109,8,2,2,The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock.  He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star.  Paul was also confused.  He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
20110,8,2,2,"When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard's track career ended because of receiving poor grades, Paul felt sorry for him. He knew Mr. Leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him, so Paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping Mr. Leonard in his struggles as well. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard in the way that he knows what its like to be one of the ones who doesn't get good grades, and being embarassed about the fact of not being able to read near as well as others. Paul immediately realizes all that Mr. Leonard has helped him accomplish, and he wants to help Mr. Leonard accomplish something of his own."
20111,8,0,1,Paul thinks he cna over come anything ads long as he can stick with it and practice. At first Paul was not a very good runner. Then Mr. Lenord told him to bring sneakers and shorts the next day. Whne Paul got serious about running and put his mind to running the he would do very good at running. So if Paul can Practice and be good at running he will not be picked last any more for sports and will do good at his favorite sport.
20112,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul received about Mr. Leonard helped him to realize why Mr. Leonard had been helping him to excel at running. Paul felt a connection with Mr. Leonard, and wanted to do whatever he could to help Mr. Leonard achieve his goals in return for Mr. Leonard helping Paul to learn how to run. This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed."
20113,8,1,0,"When Paul gets background information in Mr. Leonard, he sees that, just like Paul, he struggled with reading and was also a runner.  Paul foreshadowed Mr. Leonard's story growing up through high school and college."
20114,8,1,1,Paul was empithetic because he to knew how Mr. Leonard was feeling. 'I knew them well-feelings of embaressment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't konw an answer everyone else knew.'
20115,8,2,2,"Learning about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in many ways. When he realizes that Mr. Leonard was a successfull hurdeler, he feels proud and surprised that Mr. Leonard would take the time to help Paul succeed. When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard's struggle to learn, Paul feels a connection with him. He understands how Mr. Lownard felt and after hearing his story, he knows that he wants to do well in school. Before he didn't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future. Learning Mr. Leonard's background information helped Paul be even more determined to succeed."
20116,8,2,1,"The background information had a positive effect on Paul, it gave him the motivation to overcome the hurdles he was going through.Even tho Mr.Leonard wasn't the stongest student he was able to compete athleticly.It helped connect the two."
20117,8,1,1,The effect it has on Paul is suprised. He was working with somone who was really good at what he was teaching this kid. Paul was excited that he has someone to relate to and he might become sombody.
20118,8,2,2,The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something. When Mr. Leonard asked Paul about the learning center Mr. Leonard let paul go after he told him he couldnt read. Now the information that Paul got effected him by making him realize that since he cat read it doesnt mean that he cant be good at other things like sports. Because after Paul gave the information printout to Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard told him that since he couldnt read he had to quite track because he couldnt read and because of his grades in school. And after he was told that Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the sense that they both couldnt read and that since Mr. Leonard helped him Paul has to help Mr. leonard learn to read.
20119,8,1,1,"After learing this background information, Paul realizes why Mr. Leonard is just like him."
20120,8,0,0,"Paul would have almost the same background as him, except pauls would be about high school."
20121,8,1,1,"Paul realizes that it is not just him that has problems. Anyone can over come the problems that one might have in life, and still better themselves."
20122,8,1,1,The background information about Mr. Leonard has an effect on Paul that made him realize that he could help Mr. Leonard in the same way he helped him. At the end of the story he understood him more after and went on to help him.
20123,8,1,0,"He relixes that he was a great at the hurdels. Soon Paul relizes that Mr. Leonard was a Track and Feild star back in collage and continues to let him coach to get ready to try out for the team. As Paul confronts Mr Leonard about his past, at first he seems sadened by it. 'I was a good athlete,' 'but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied onfriends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'     'But you went to collage,' Paul said     'Things were different back then,' Mr. Leonard replied. 'The collage scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work ia a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'     'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' Paul said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'"
20124,8,2,2,"Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills. This brings him closer to Mr. Leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running."
20125,8,2,2,"Paul was surprised and when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit. He pressed for the answer by asking 'Well, what happened after that?'. Mr. Leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship, causing him to flunk our of college. Paul felt he could relate to Mr. Leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him. Telling him 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' as they walked back towards the school. 'It's time to start your training.'. So now they have both learned something from eachother, one was how to work hard and become good at a sport, and then teach one how to read better."
20126,8,2,2,Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school. Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody.
20127,8,0,0,"Paul was worried about his reading dissabilities. Mr. Leonard was pushing paul to be good at track, becuase Mr. Leonard knew that paul would have a better chance then he ever would at succeeding in track and in studies."
20128,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard used to be a good track star, but ended up dropping out because he couldn't read. When Mr. Leonard finds out Paul can't read he helps him get better at hurdles. Then since Mr. Leonard helped Paul get better at something, Paul helps Mr. Leonard get better at something he was bad at."
20129,8,1,1,"Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's beackground information because it is the same thing he is going through, And Paul feels empathetic towards Mr. Leonard."
20130,8,2,2,"The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard effents him because he finds out he is being taught by a former great. This boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes Paul want to achieve goals.      When Paul learns Mr. Leonard flunked out it motivates him to try to get better as a student because without the grades, he would never make it in college. He also wants to return the favor by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read."
20131,8,0,0,The background information has a effect because he didn't know that he was in track and it would have been easier for Paul to say something to him if he knew about it.
20132,8,0,0,Paul is used to obeying Mr. Leonard. He does not ussualy stop and talk to him and seems a little nervous around him.
20133,8,2,2,The background information changes Paul's view on the Mr. Leonard. He knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard read while Mr. Leonard teaches him how to hurdle in a sort of compensation in Paul's eyes. Paul feels more motivated at the end of the story because Mr. Leonard is like him in so many ways that he feels he can achieve something like he had done in college.
20134,8,1,1,The information brought Mr. Leonard and Paul closer because Paul felt like Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarrassment were familiar to himself.
20135,8,1,2,When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background information he feels that he can relate to him. Paul could tell that when Mr. Leonard told him what happen to him in college he was embarassed just like he was when he was chosen to read something aloud and didn't know the answer. He feels grateful that Mr. Leonard had given up his time to help him excel at something. Then Paul felt that he had to help him out.
20136,8,2,2,"Paul became very compassionate after getting information from Mr. Leonard. Paul started to understand how Mr. Leonard feeling about his life so Paul decided to teach him how to read. Also, Paul got some motivations for himself by the story of Mr. Leonard. He found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle, he still have to study very hard. He still should finish his college and get his scholarship. Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard's experience. No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read. That made Paul want to study harder than before."
20137,8,1,1,"The information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul greatly. Paul now has to goals to strive for, hurdles and reading. Mr Leonard's personal feats will push Paul harder and further to reach his goals."
20138,8,1,1,"Paul found information on the website Mr. Leonard asked him to look up. He found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete in college. Leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at Nationals, but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor. Leonard didn't want Paul to be like him. He wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time. So he helped paul train and Paul helped him how to read."
20139,8,2,2,"The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him. He finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle, was actually a really good hurdler in school. When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article. Paul comes with a grin on his face, that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like Mr.Leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle."
20140,8,0,0,The effect of the background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard is Paul now knows that he is not the only one with a hard time. It helps Paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish.
20141,8,2,2,The backround information about Mr. Leonard excites Paul because Paul is likeing doing track every day and is ammazed by the success that Mr. Leonard has had with track in college. Then the information about how Mr. Leonard couldnt read inspires Paul because Paul is going through the same thing.
20142,8,1,2,Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him with track. He also realizes why the first time at the track Mr. Leonard did not know his name.
20143,8,0,1,"The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on the reader is that Mr. Leonard could not read and he was trying to help someone that was also in his postion, so it shows that he is a kind man that cares about people and helps people if they need it.  The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he realizes that he can be successfull, just like Mr. Leonard, even though he can not read."
20144,8,2,2,"Paul feels he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul knows how if feels to not be able to read. He knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud. Also, he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew."
20145,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr.Leonard motivated Paul and encourage him  of working harder. There are many plots that can support the point, among which one detail is predominant.  As it is mentioned in the paragragh, when Paul heard the experience of Mr. Leonard, he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class. Mr.Leonard's story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesn't study hard and give it up, it will cause a great pity in his life.   From what has been discussed above, the background information of Mr. Leonard had a positive influence on Paul, motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for Mr. Leonard."
20146,8,0,0,The backgroung information affected Paul by letting him know Mr. Leonard can't read too.  This shows Paul that he can get better and not give up.  It also build his relationship with Mr. Leonard by going to the learning center together.
20147,8,2,2,Paul is amazed. He couldn't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college.
20148,8,2,2,"Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles. The final paragraph reads, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'"
20149,8,2,2,"Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, like himself. He also found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he couldn't go any further in track than he did because he couldn't read. With finding that out Paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and Mr. Leonard could work on it together."
20150,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul in life, because no one helped Mr. Leonard. Instead of just letting Paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him Mr. Leonard steps up and gives Paul what Mr. Leonard himself never had."
20151,8,2,2,The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard. It surprises Paul because he asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star. The information also encourages him because at the end of the reading Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20152,8,2,2,He finds out that mr. Leonard is a poor reader and Paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder.
20153,8,1,2,"In the beginning of the story Paul thinks Mr. Leonard is just the hall montitor. Then after he gets the background information on Mr.Leonard his viewpoint changes. He realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him, but Mr. Leonard didn't have a learning center to help him read when he was in school. This caused Mr. keonard to flunk out of college which is why he is helping Paul. Also the background information makes Paul emphatic towards Mr. Leonard and will probably cause him to go to college and not flunk out for Mr. Leonard."
20154,8,0,0,The background information influences Paul. It is because of the information that he wants to join the track team.
20155,8,1,1,After he found out so much information about Mr.Leonards background it incouraged him to work even harder. He started to believe in himself. He new that he could accomplish anything as long as he put his mind to it. Not only did he believe in himself Mr.Leonard believed in him too.
20156,8,2,2,"Paul feels the same Mr. Leonard does,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had to given the time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.     Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too.'C'mon, Mr. leonard,' I said walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'' Paul is inspired to help out Mr. leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college, he is eager to help.It's one of the best things to do is help someone, even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks."
20157,8,0,0,"In this story, the background information about Mr. Leonard, especially at the end, is similar to the situation the narrator was in.  For example, at the end, when Mr. Leonard mentioned that he had failed out of college, which was comparable to the situation the narrator was in because of his inability to read.  Realizing this, Mr. Leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did, he can overcome the obstacles, which were similar to the obstacles he had."
20158,8,0,0,"The effect that Paul had was consideration more than anything because Mr. Leonard was just a  hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that. When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he wanted to find out why Mr. Leonard 'gave up' on his dream, but he later found out that he flunked out of college. Paul found this out because he look up that URL that the track coach gave him and he asked andpushed the answers to Pauls questions. So he tried to live his dream out on Paul in a way."
20159,8,1,1,The information Paul gets inspires him to keep up the good work. Paul also knows that he needs to keep up his tutoring in order to stay on the team.
20160,8,1,1,"He was suprised to discover that he was so good at one point in time and he wanted to know what happened, and why their weren't any other stories."
20161,8,2,2,It makes Paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems. Also they are both good hurdelers.
20162,8,0,0,In the baxkgroung ionformation it effects paul majorly because he thought that the teacher was great!! He did not know that he ran track or did any field activities until he recieved that website from a coach.  He was kind of upset about it but he got up and encouraged his teacher to get back on the track.
20163,8,2,2,"When Mr. Leonard tells Paul, 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf. I belive that information made Paul think of his future and how him and Mr. Leonard aren't that different. Also, when Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him."
20164,8,2,2,"It has a very big effect on Paul because, Mr. Leonard went to college to be on the track team and he flunked out because he was not a good student, Paul is also having a problem with his grades because he cannot read very well, so he goes to the remedial reading program twice a week.  And he looks up to Mr. Leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did.      Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because the college scouts told him that there would be tutors at the college that could help him get his grades up, but there were'nt any so he flunked.  Mr. Leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing."
20165,8,2,2,Well Paul dose not know how to read that good. And when he gets on the URL and when he asked Mr. Leonard about it and he says he dose not know how to read. Paul knows how that feels. And then he gose and showes him how to read.
20166,8,0,0,I believe that Paul is changed even more by finding out about Mr. Leonard's college life. It shows Paul that even if you're bad at education you can still be great at other things. It opens up a new world for Paul is what I'm saying overall.
20167,8,2,1,"The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul realize that eventhough  he might be terrible at reading, he needs to keep practicing and overcome his fears, just like he has done with the hurdles."
20168,8,2,2,"Paul learns that Mr.Leonard was very good at track in college. It effeects Paul because Paul is pretty much just like Mr.Leonard, he is good at track but not so good in school."
20169,8,0,1,The background that Paul got of Mr.Leonard effected him possitively. Now that Paul knows just because you can't read doesn't mean you can't do anything you put your mind to.
20170,8,1,1,It tells him that if Mr. Leonard can win at these huirdles and teach him how to do it. He can teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20171,8,0,0,"Paul is in the same situation as Mr. Leonard. When mr. Leonard asked Paul what his name is  he should of known it because he had check Paul's pass for the past two weeks, but Mr/ Leonard did not know it because he could not read."
20172,8,2,2,"Paul feels some what connect to Mr. Leonard, seeing how they both have reading disabilty and now they are both good at jumping hurdles. Mr. Leonard that since he didnt get proper help with his reading problem and Paul was that Paul could do better then him with reading and track."
20173,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard helps Paul find something that he can be good at, and Paul probably takes Mr. Leonard's kindness for granted. He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard's kindness, but fails to see Mr. Leonard's motives. When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college, it profoundly changes Paul's view of Mr. Leonard.      According to Paul, 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed. Mr. Leonard's story also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return, by helping him improve his reading skills."
20174,8,0,0,"Mr. leonard is like Paul, a poor reader. so he feels bad for him. also he sees himself in him by taking him to the track. He is good at track just like he was. Also he was a poor reader and thats why he flunked out of college."
20175,8,2,2,"In the story, the trach coach advises Paul to look up background information on Mr. Leonard.  Whe he does, he discovers that Mr. Leonard was just like him.  They both had problems reading.  Therefore, Paul understood why Mr. Leonard tried so hard to help him excel at something.  Paul also understood how Mr. Leonard felt; embarrassment, and the longing to be like other kids. It affects Paul because now he knows that he can be good at whatever he puts his mind to, all thanks to Mr. Leonard."
20176,8,2,2,"The background information on Mr. Leonard is impowering for Paul in specific ways. Paul had no idea about Mr. Leonard because a Track and Feild star, but he listened to him anyways, when the coach gave him the URL to look him up he was surpirsed. When he confronted Mr. Leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce. He wondered what happened, why he hadn't done it since he won the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman. Paul could really relate his story to Mr. Leonard because he as well couldn't read. Unlike Mr. Leonard, he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read. When Mr. Leonard was done explaining his story he thought since he help him that he would help him learn how to read. The background information help him connect with Mr. Leonard on a whole new level."
20177,8,0,0,Paul ask Mr. Leonard why he kept such a proud accomplishment from him.
20178,8,0,1,The background information helps paul by relizing if you want ot become a good athlete you have to be an even better student to do what you like do to.
20179,8,1,1,"At first, Paul probably felt confused and upset with Mr. Leonard for not telling Paul about his past, but when Mr. Leonard told him why he didn't tell Paul, Paul understood why.  They were both in the same situation, somewhat."
20180,8,0,0,well this collage student said he want to be an athlete and win lot of matals
20181,8,2,2,"During the story 'Gifts' Paul learns some interesting and shocking information about Mr Leonard. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a 400 meter champion and he questioned him what happened after, once Mr. Leonard reveals the information to Paul, he was shocked. Paul realized that he wasn't alone and he had someone who was like him, someone who couldn't read. Knowing this, Paul was releaved and was glad to help Mr. Leonard with his reading."
20182,8,0,0,It shows him that even though Mr. Leonard can't read that he can still do other things just as well as other people. It also shows him that he will need to try hard and never give up.
20183,8,2,2,He felt familiar with the emotions of embarrrassment that Mr. Leonard felt. Paul was grateful that Mr. Leonard had given his time to help him succeed at something. He wanted to show respect and help Mr. Leonard do something too. He wanted to help him learn to read.
20184,8,2,2,"During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a great 400 meter hurdler. Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard because he had trouble reading as well. This motivates Paul to work hard during school and on the track."
20185,8,0,1,paul see's Mr.Leonard is a role model and that paul wants to help him.
20186,8,2,2,"When paul found out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdle, he wonderd why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him. They when paul figured out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, paul knew felt his pain. Paul also has a hard time in school. Paul wanted to do something for Mr. Leonard because he helped him with hurdles. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read."
20187,8,0,0,The background information effects people because it showed that everybody is good at something in life.
20188,8,2,2,"He feels that it was strange that Mr. Leonard doesn't share with him his past acheivements, when he's training him to run hurdles.  So he is supprised that Mr. Leonard is such a great hurdler, and it prompts him to ask why he didn't continue that carreer.  When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard flunking out of college he felt sympathetic for him because he couldn't read either."
20189,8,1,1,Paul seems more confident about himself that now he knows Mr. Leonards background. Paul his happy that he knows somebody that also struggled in school just like him.
20190,8,2,2,Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he flunked out due to bad grades. Paul was suprised that someone that good was teaching to him to succeed like Mr.Leonard did.
20191,8,1,2,"When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard struggled with the work required of him in high school and college, he feels immediately sympathetic toward the hall monitor because of his similar situation. In my opinion, he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point, and he realized at last why Mr. Leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school. As is usually the case with students and their teachers, Paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that Mr. Leonard has had his own difficulties in life.     However, Mr. Leonard's story also has another effect on Paul - It encourages him to work harder so he doesn't suffer the same fate. After this, Paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes. After being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so, he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like Mr. Leonard has.     Paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school, which he took for granted in the past. Although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about, he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when Mr. Leonard didn't have the same luxury."
20192,8,2,2,The background information makes Paul look at his own life and see that he is struggling with same things that Mr.Leonard delt with. Mr. Leonard was a track star ut he could not read. He flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read. At the end of the story Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him read.
20193,8,2,2,The background information shown who Mr. Leonard aws in the past. Paul seen this and was encouraged by this becasue he was like Mr. Leonard. this help him to practice runnung and he help Mr.Leonard to practice reading.
20194,8,1,2,paul finds out that mr. leonard was a track star and stoped because he couldnt read so paul teaches him to read because mr. leonard tought him something.
20195,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard got backgroung information o Paul so he knew a little abut him. This helped him do things better. He practiced with him.
20196,8,0,0,he was a hall monitor and he mad sure people were always on tie for class no matter what. and then it hit him he was training to be on the track team and he trained and trained and trained and he finally saw himself before thter track coach.
20197,8,1,1,"It makes Paul realize why he had him running on the track, because Mr. Leonard used to be a track star who also struggled with reading."
20198,8,2,2,"In the begininng of the story, Mr. Leonard is the mentor and helps Paul feel more involved in more activities than he already was.  Mr. Leonard also helps Paul not feel like an outcast.  Mr. Leonard stays after school even longer to help Paul. Unspokingly Mr. Leonard has gone through the same trouble that Paul is currently facing.  Paul then later finds that Mr. Leonard faced the same trouble in high school.     Paul acts as if he is the mentor when he finds out about Mr. Leoanrd's situation in high school.  Pauls act of saying, 'It's time to start your training' to Mr. Leonard shows the value of a true relationship.  Paul is helping Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard helped him.  One kind act to another is exactly what has happened. Without any of the background information, none of this would have happened."
20199,8,1,1,"Once Paul understands the background of coach, it can reassure him that he has what it takes to overcome the obsticle. He does not feel as isolated or alone. He realizes that there are other individuals out there with the same problems, and if they can overcome them, he can too."
20200,8,2,2,"The Narrater, paul, is shocked beacause Mr. Leanard was helping him and he never told him that he couldnt read either. It drove him to try harder on reading and to help him  beacuse Mr. Leanard never got the chance to get help with reading. 'The emotions in Mr. leanard's words were all to familier to me.'"
20201,8,0,2,Paul was amazed by what he found out about Mr.Leonard. He found out that Mr.Leonard was a freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records.
20202,8,2,2,The effect that Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is he can relate to him. Paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports. Mr. Leonard can't read but was a very good athlete. Both of them are like one another and know how the other feels. They both feel embarrassed because they can't read but like to do hurdles. Since Paul discovered this information he wants to help Mr. Leonard read just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to do the hurdles.
20203,8,1,1,It effected paul in a positive way. It gave Paul a better understanding on why Mr. Leonard was helping him.
20204,8,0,0,"It shows that anyone can play a sport without have learning capablities. Also, that Paul could learn just about anything if he had practice."
20205,8,0,0,Paul needs help and needs to work more harder on the way he exercises. Paul needs to be concentrated and very smart to try new things.
20206,8,2,2,He realizes that they are much a like. They both have trouble reading. It changes the way he looks at Mr. Leonard.
20207,8,1,1,"The background information Paul received was shocking, but inspirational. He didn't know that mr. leonard was going through the same thing as he was when he was in school. So he tried to help Paul earlier than when he was in school, because he didn't have anyone to help him early in life."
20208,8,1,2,Paul is confused and probably a little disappointed that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his college days. Paul also understands when Mr. Leonard tells him about his flunking out. He says how the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to him.
20209,8,2,2,After Paul got a background check on Mr. Leonard it had really touched him. Mr. Leonard explained to him that he had flunked out. So Paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center.
20210,8,2,2,"When reading the article, the reader first sees Mr. Leonard as a kind of mean guy, that just likes to heard people along in the hallways at schoool, because he is a hall monitor. Later on in the story when Mr. Leonard takes Paul under his wing to teach him how to be a good runner the reader learns that Mr.Leonard used to be a very succesful track runner, and used to be very well known. The reader also learns that he flunked out of college, and that's why he is no longer a runner.      Paul is a kid that can't read, and Mr. Leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner, because he thinks it will help him out. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well. In the process of joining the high school track team Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a very well known track star. This confuses Paul on why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.     When Paul asks why he wasn't told he learns that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he didn't want to brag about how good he used to be, and that he was also embarrased because he had flunked out of school because he couldn't read.          The fact the Mr. Leonard took Paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better, and that Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean Mr. Leonard is and Paul sees that and is very greatful."
20211,8,2,2,"The background information that the Paul finds on Mr. Leonard is very emotional for him because he dicoovers the reason that Mr. Leonard is so motivated to help him. Paul has the same problem that Mr. Leonard has with reading, but the only difference is that Paul gets help for his reading and Mr. Leonard didn't. So when he sees an apportunirty to help Paul  he does and is return Paul helps Mr. Leonard in the end."
20212,8,0,0,He gets information that Mr. Leonard was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20213,8,1,1,Mr. Leonard's background informatioon gave Paul incouragement to do better and push harder. It also helped Paul to realize that you have to work in school to make the grades that you want. Paul could relate to excatly how Mr Leonard felt. When Paul heard Mr Leonard tell his story he heard the emotion in his voice that was very familiar to him.
20214,8,2,2,"During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr.Leonard. The effects of that background information make Paul realize that he needed to work hard for things that he wants in life. This information also makes Paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while he's at school. An example with details would be, 'The emotions in Mr.Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well- feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Also, Mr.Leonard's background information makes Paul want to excel at something, and Paul wants to help out Mr.Leonard."
20215,8,1,1,When Paul finds this information it leads him to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. Paul knows that this man understands the feelings of embarrassment that Paul has during school or when he is trying to read.
20216,8,2,2,When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard past it shows him that he can overcome his obstacles the way that Mr. Leonard did.  Paul understands why Mr. Leonard put so much effort into him. Also he should continue with his training so that he can get a schoolarship like Mr. Leonard.
20217,8,2,1,I think that the background effected Paul in a good and bad way. Paul understands and knows how Mr. Leonard feels. Paul tells Mr. Leonard to come on and that it is time to start his training.
20218,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student like Paul. Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul but didn't have learning centers in high school, he had to use his friends for help, but it was still too hard for him."
20219,8,2,2,In the story paul learns that mr. leonard was very talented at hurdles and even broke records as a college freshman. I think that this information paul learns has him a little confused on what happend to make Mr. Leonard in the postion that he is today. when Mr. Leonard explains to him that he wasnt the strongest student and cant read very well it ties the whole story together and i think paul then realizes why Mr. leonard wants to train him. In  the end of the story they kinda let us believe that paul is going to now help mr. Leonard with his reading.
20220,8,2,2,Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was such a famous track star. He was in shock when he found out tht Mr. Leonard had won so many trophy's and that he won the 400 meter in hurddles.
20221,8,1,1,When Paul learns the background information on Mr. Leonard I think he felt like he had something in common with him. Both characters have learning disabilities and now both run track. I think Paul definitley felt like he had someone to look up to.
20222,8,2,2,that he didnt know that he was a track star when he went to collage and then Mr. Leonard told him that he dropped out because he didnt know how to read its was the same thing for Paul because he is good at hurdles but he is only in highschool but he also does not know how to read but he is getting help and can read a little bit and is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read to.
20223,8,1,1,"After learning about Mr. Leonard's background, I think Paul starts to understand Mr. Leonard better.  He used to be a suspicious quiet man but now Paul feels that he and Mr. Leonard are alike in the fact that they both had trouble in school. Paul feels more comfortable knowing that Mr. Leonard is like him and that he understands how Paul feels."
20224,8,1,1,Paul begins to feel empathetic for Mr. Leonard because he knows what it's like to fell embarrassed when he was called upon to read and couldn't or didn't know quite as much as the other kids. I think he also realizes that there are others that have reading problems and can set those aside and work hard to achieve set goals.
20225,8,2,2,"Paul can't read just like Mr. Leonard. Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt because he too could not read. Paul then started to train Mr. Leonard too read, because he helped Paul with something, Paul wanted to return the favor."

It isn't until Paul gets stopped by Mr. Leonard one day that we first get a glimpse of who this hall monitor is. Many foreshadowing events occur from this point forward- the empathy in his eyes when he learns Paul can't read, the mysterious way he calls Paul to the gym and then to the track, and even the encouragement he gives to Paul gives the reader many hints on who this character is as a person. When the track coach gives Paul some interesting information to look up about this said hall monitor, that is when we really see who Mr. Leonard was. We learn how successful he was on the track, but when asked about this we also learn how unsuccessful he was off the track. Paul is very shocked to hear Mr. Leonard Grabowski was an avid hurdle jumping track participent in his day, but when he goes directly to the man behind all of it, Mr. Leonard, he gets a more personal outlook on what it was truly like for him. This gives Paul a new appreciation for his education, but also for Mr. Leonard after realizing just who this hall monitor once was, and in a way- still is."
20449,8,2,2,The information that the Paul gets about Mr. Leonard during the story helps him want to train harder because when he found out that Mr. Leonard could not read and he was a track star in college it motivated him to want to try his hardest at something that he enjoyed doing.

This makes Paul relize that Mr. Leonard and him are the same in the way that they are both good runners, but bad readers.

20465,8,2,2,"It gives Paul confidence because now he knows he is not the only one that is not able to read either. At the beginning of the story he felt all alone, and was tired of always being the last one chosen for a game. When Mr. Leonard came along and helped boost his confidence.

He was curious to why Mr. Leonard had not ran anymore after that. Once Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard had gone through the same thing he was he knew how Mr. Leonard had felt because he had the same feelings of embarrassment. Mr. Leonard could not read either, so when he went to college he lost his scholarship and flunked out, but no other school wanted a runner that could not read. Paul then decided to do something for Mr. Leonard, and tell him to start his training."
20473,8,2,2,"When Paul found out Mr. Leonard was in track and had broken records he was suprised, and wondered why he did not hear about it before. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read he felt sympathetic for him because he wasnt good at reading either."
20474,8,2,2,"Paul is suprised to see that Mr. Leonard was a excellent runner, but he also develops sympathy towards his teacher because he says in line 45, ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.

This is told when the article says, 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 ,eter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.' (line 38-39). This proves to Paul that even though he is unable to read well, he is still able to be the best at something else i his life.     Mr. Leonard also encourages Paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read. Mr. Leonards says, 'I lost my scholarship and flunnked out.' (line 47). This statement is important to Paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner.

So then Mr. Leonard thinks that he should ask Paul to start hurdling, and if he works hard in that just like he does in school, then maybe he can go off to college for hurdling but if he gets good grades he won't flunk out and that will make Mr. Leonard forget about his past a little."

However, he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship.     I think Paul relates to what Mr. Leonard went through so well is because Paul was basically going through the same thing. He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read. Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class, but he was extremely embarrassed. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better. He wants Paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read.

20625,8,2,2,I think Paul is shocked too find out that Mr. Leonard broke records. He asked questions about it and seemed very interested.
20626,8,2,1,"As Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he is a bit moved. He realizes though he is becoming good at hurdles, he needs to learn to read so he doesn't become like Mr. Leonard. He also realizes then that education comes before athletics. Paul can relate to all of this, because he is in that current situation. In 45 it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-- feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew. Paul then decides that Mr. Leonard has done him a favor, and has helped him reach a goal... to excel at something. 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him (Line 48). Paul realizes that he needs to excel in academics now, and help Mr. Leonard in the process."
20627,8,0,1,"When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can not read very well, he probably feels a lot more relaxed.  He knew he didn't have to prove anything to him.  Mr. Leonard understood where Paul was coming from.  It gave him comfort, but Paul still wanted to make Mr. Leonard proud."
20628,8,2,2,"The background information surprised Paul, but also made him curious as to why he did not continue to break records. When Paul found out Mr. Leonard also could not read, Paul knew the embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt so he wanted to help him learn to read."
20629,8,2,1,it has a really deep effect on paul because he is starting to become a track star and he doesnt want to go down the same path as mr. leonard. paul also helps mr leonard out with his reading at the end of the passage
20630,8,0,0,"The background information has more so of a good effect on Paul. From finding out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and couldn't read, probably made Paul feel as if he can do almost anything. It also probably made Paul want to read, because Mr. Leonard said, 'No other college wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So hopefully that put some type of effort into Paul."
20631,8,1,2,Paul gets to know Mr. Lwonard better throughout the story. I feel like they had a lot in common so they got along well together. They both didn't know how to read and they both could jump hurdles. I think that Paul felt like he wasn't an outcast any more becuase he found someone that was like him in so many ways. I think he found a friend that day.
20632,8,0,0,Paul cant read and so do to that its hard for him to do his work. So he has bad grades and cant make any school sprots team. But Mr.Leonard could help him
20633,8,1,0,Mr.Leonard's background information has alot of impact on Paul mainly because Paul is facing the same problem. Mr. Leonard explains to him that he can be a good athlete but school is important to. Through the teachers past Paul has started to open his eyes.
20634,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was a great track athelet when he was in college. There was one problem, he also couldn't read. He had broken many records in his college years. He had got kicked out of college becuase he couldn't read. Mr. Leonard had lost all of his scholarships and flucked out. Paul was thinking about that could be him. He was trying to keep this all away from Paul so that he wouldn't start to think that he could also be kicked from school becuase nobody wants a 'runner who cant read'."
20635,8,2,2,Paul knows what its like to not be able to read. So he feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and decides to help him.
20636,8,0,0,The information makes Paul realize that Mr. Leonard needed help with schoolwork to. He found out he was a good hurdeler but couldnt do college work and wanted to help him.
20637,8,0,0,The fact that Mr. Leonard dropped out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read really effects Paul because he to cannot read very well.
20638,8,2,2,He ws shocked at first because he didn't think that Mr.Leonard could've ben a track star. But then he is more understanding as he finds out that he couldn't read. He is also inspired to help Mr.Leonard with reading because he had helped Paul with getting into track and wanted to help him back.
20639,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul somewhat confused at first, because he does not know why he would hide his past of being a track star. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul the whole story, Paul is empathetic with Mr. Leonard's situation because he is in a similar situation, and decides to help him with his past."
20640,8,2,2,"Paul feels like he is in Mr. Leonard's shoes when he was younger. In the story Paul states,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This gave Paul motivation to achieve something for not only himself but Mr. Leonard who was not able to achieve much in school."
20641,8,2,2,"Paul is very thankful towards Mr. Leonard for helping him get faster. Paul says in the passage, 'It's time to start your training.' this is a way that paul can help Mr. leonard on his reading and to repay him for what he done for him. the background information helps paul realize that not everyone is the same, and that he isn't the only person that can't read. Mr. Leonard gave paul some confidence."
20642,8,2,2,"When Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in high school and in college but did poorly academicly it encouraged him to try his best. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was one of the best hurdlers, but when he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read no other school wanted him, even though he was one of the best. This showed Paul that even though you could be one of the best at a sport it doesn't matter if you don't have the grades."
20643,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was great for Paul and Mr. Leonard.  Paul realized that he could do something he never thought of doing with the help of Mr. Leonard.  Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard, just like Mr. Leonard helped him."
20644,8,1,2,The background information makes Paul relate more to Mr. Leonard. Paul had felt the embarassment that Mr. Leonard had felt. Such as when Paul was asked to come up to the front of the class to read. Paul realised that his life was a flashback for Mr. Leonard and his difficult school life.
20645,8,2,2,"When Mr. Leonard hands Paul the URL, and Paul looks him up, he realizes something important. Mr. Leonard and Paul had something in common. They both struggled with reading. Mr. Leonard saw an opportunity to help Paul achieve his goals, and he took that opportunity.     Obviously, when Mr. Leonard looked at Paul, he saw himself as a child. He remembered what it was like to be in his position. So, Paul was blessed to have someone like him to help. Paul realizes that just because he is chosen last for teams, and he is unable to read, doesn't mean he is unable to do other important things. Mr. Leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help Paul so he could achieve his dreams."
20646,8,0,0,THAT MR. LEONARD WANT TO COLLEGE AND RUN TRACK AND FIELD AND THAT HE SHOULD COACH IT.
20647,8,2,2,When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a runner also he is very surprised. Paul first wants to know why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about it. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul knows exactly what Mr. Leonard went through because he is going through the same thing. Paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he can't read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me.' Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him.
20648,8,0,0,After Mr. leonard helps paul become a great runner he went and talked to the rack coach. He soon found out that Mr. leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it. the effect of learning Mr. Leonard was a great runner was that he really knew what he was doing and taught paul very well. Paul also learned that without education its hard to keep your dreams alive. If Mr. Leonard would have known to read he could have made even more records to beat.
20649,8,2,2,"While training with Mr. Leonard, Paul learns more about him and his past. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not just a hall monitor, in fact Mr. Leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard wasn't the best student and eventually flunked ou tof college because of his grades.      As Mr. Leonard is telling Paul about his past Paul understands the feelings of embarassment and was empathetic towards Mr. Leonard. Paul is in a similar situation as Mr. Leonard; however Paul recieves helps from the school's reading center. Paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him."
20650,8,0,0,"He learns that paul is a good kid, that can pick things up quick. So he help him by learning one thing, so that he can learn how to read better"
20651,8,1,1,"When Paul recieves information about Mr. Leonard he is surprised that Mr. Leonard never mentioned it to him. He was somewhat in awe of Mr. Leonard for his achievements, and even more so for his will to help people like him."
20652,8,2,2,"It suprises paul and makes him want to work harder and makes him sympathetic.  In the last paragraph, paul wants Mr. Leonard to start training.  Paul also is a little confused on how Mr. Leonard didnt make it as a runner.  In paragraph 43, paul mentions that Mr. Leonard went to colleage."
20653,8,1,2,"The effect that background information has on Paul is it made him want to help Mr. Leonard learn to read and for him to never give up. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he remembered how embarrassed he always feels because he cannot read. Paul feels like he relates to Mr. Leonard in that way because they both have obstacles they need to overcome. Paul now understands and wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. Also, Mr. Leonard's background has taught Paul to never give up learning because he can overcome it and become successful."
20654,8,1,1,The background effects Paul because Paul had no idea he was learning from a champion. They both shared something and helped eachother all the way through.
20655,8,2,2,"The background information presented about Mr. Leonard is effective in the fact that Paul can realize his own true potential.      In the story, Paul not only learns about Mr. Leonard's past as a track 'star', but also about his stuggles with learning. This information motivates Paul because he realizes that he has more opprotunities than Mr. Leonard ever did and that even though Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, his school work was more important; grades really do matter.      This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection. Through this connection, they can both help each other out."
20656,8,1,1,"The background information the reader gets effected Paul by motivating him. He felt as if everyone has a strong point and that everyone deserves help in something no matter what it is. Also, it makes him feel like everything gets better with practice."
20657,8,1,1,"The effect that background information about Mr. Leonard was a shock to him. Mr. Leonard never did think that Paul would do research about him from his past. From the story it says 'He looked at me quizzically, then smiled sadly at the image on the page.' Mr. Leonard was very speechless because what Paul showed him, brought back a big memory of Mr. Leonard."
20658,8,1,1,"The backround information had a big effect on Paul.  Paul felt more comfortable an he understood Mr. Leonard more, after he found out the information."
20659,8,2,2,Paul was suprized at what Mr Leonard has acomplished in college even though he flunked out.
20660,8,0,0,he was a good track runner in his day.
20661,8,1,0,pau obey leonard. so that is why he listenings to him alot. and look up to leonard.
20662,8,2,2,"He learns that Mr. Leanard was a great track runner for his college, that he even broke records. Paul feels more conected to Mr. Leonard because he too can't read."
20663,8,0,0,Both Mr. Leonard and Paul were not very good students in school. Mr.Leonard was amazying in track but since he did not get good grades in class he lost he scholarship and flunked out of school. Paul is not very good in class either. When Mr.Leonard helps him learn how to jump hurtles good he had him go out for the boy track them. In a way they are exactly the same.
20664,8,2,2,"When Paul is told to look up Mr. Leonard, he finds out that he was a track star and was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read.  Paul sees that he's not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read.  Mr. Leonard is very supportive and Paul is no longer embarrased about his situation."
20665,8,0,0,"The background effects Paul by slowly showing him that he is being taught by one of the greats and, he can over come his objectives."
20666,8,2,2,"Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, yet he had to drop out because of his lack of intellegence. This helps paul to connect more to his coach and want to work hard for Mr. Leonard, and have Mr. Leonard work hard for him."
20667,8,2,1,"The information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard is the he used to be an amazing college athlete who broke many records, he found this out by typing in the URL that the track coach had given him. When he saw what a great athlete Mr. Leonard was he confronted him about it. When he questioned Mr. Leonard about his athletic career he also found out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he struggled in school, mainly because he could not read. That's when eveythign clicked for Paul. He understood why Mr. Leonard was excited about Paul going to the learning center, why he wanted to help him run hurdles, why he asked him his name, and Paul knew how he could help Mr. Leonard in return. Just like Mr. Leonard had helped Paul jump his hurdles, he was going to return the favor."
20668,8,2,2,"Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level.  Mr. Leonard raced his way to several records then, but Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard had quit. Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports."
20669,8,1,2,Paul seems to be compassionate with Mr. Leonard in the story as he finds out Mr. Leonard could not read either. Mr. Leonard explained how he had to rely on his friends for homework help and Paul immediately felt empathy towards him.
20670,8,2,2,Paul is surprised to learn that Mr. Leonard was a star in college in hurdling and that he had won 400 titles.It makes Paul compare himself to Leonard since they were having the same kind of problems in life.It makes Paul want to struggle hard and believe he can achieve much in life despite the fact that he was not good academically.
20671,8,0,0,because Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to the narriator.
20672,8,0,0,The background information on Mr. Leonard is very important because it explains why Mr. Leonard is trying to make sure Paul can get better at being aan athelete.
20673,8,1,1,The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to Paul. The feelings of embarrassment when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when  he didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
20674,8,2,2,"When Paul found out Mr. Leonard was a track star and a good athlete in college, but lost his scholarship because he was not a good student, Paul started to relate to Mr. Leornard. He felt like they had the same flaws and problems. Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel in track and jumping hurdles, and Paul felt as if it was only fair if he helped Mr. Leonard to read because Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed to read aloud in front of people."
20675,8,0,0,"He feels sorry for Paul for having struggles with reading because My. Leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read. He did not want Paul to go through the same expierience he did with being so talented, but the difficulties with reading held him back from being able to do what he was good at."
20676,8,0,0,Paul gets on the computer and finds out htat Mr. Leonard has many track records from when he went to school and wonders why he is a hall monitor and why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about his records.
20677,8,1,2,Paul is stunned on how good Mr. Leonard did on his track and feild team. But is also wondering why he gave it up.
20678,8,2,2,At first Paul just sees Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor in his school. Then when the track coach tells him to search the hall monitor on a track and feild website he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a running star when he was young and also by asking Mr. Leonard he finds out that he cannot read just like Paul. It gives Paul a whole new perspective on Mr. Leonard because he then understands that the reason Mr. Leonard is helping him is that he was just like Paul at that age and he can relate to him.
20679,8,0,0,"The background information had a negative effect on Paul. Paul saw that he was an amazing track runner, but now he's just a hall monitor. What happened to his big chance in a good carer? So it kinda gave Paul a loss in hope for sucess."
20680,8,0,2,"Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in college and that he had broken many track records, while winning nationals. So, Paul then knew that he had been coached by a great athlete. He then finds out that Mr. Leonard wasn't such a good student, and that he flunked out of college. This reminded him of himself, he was good at running but not too good at school. After finding that out, he wants to help Mr. Leonard how to read, just like Mr. Leonard taught him how to do hurdles."
20681,8,1,1,The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard make him feel closer to him as a person. He understands his feelings and he understands his past because he has been through things similar to what Mr. Leonard has experienced.
20682,8,2,2,"The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit.  Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard.  The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard's past.  He happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman, but then he flunked out of college.  This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading.  At the end, Paul says, 'It's time to start your training'(paragraph 46).  This shows that Paul is grateful for Mr. Leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel.  In return, Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read."
20683,8,0,0,He found out that Mr. Lenoard is not doing well in some things. He did not go to college thinking that he would flunk it so that is the reason why.
20684,8,2,2,The coach gives Paul a website to go to. On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles. The next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off. He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read. This inspired paul knowing that Mr. leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read.
20685,8,2,2,"The first information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving. The effect of this information is that when Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track, Paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when Mr. Leonard tells him to do something. Later, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college, and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader. Paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and Mr. Leonard are not all that different. Paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center, and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to Mr. Leonard. Paul's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard's background evokes this generosity."
20686,8,2,2,"Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him.  They both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything.  At the end of the story, Paul tells Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'"
20687,8,0,0,Mr.Leonard was a track star back in his day.paul whats to be goood at something in his life like Mr. Leonard.
20688,8,0,0,"I think that paul can really do what he want if he just set his mind to it and he can be anything he want. But i also,think he can be a runer."
20689,8,2,2,"When Paul reads background information on Mr. Leonard, he is shocked to see that he had won the 400 meter hurdles and broke records. He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place."
20690,8,0,0,The effect is embarrassment and and sadness. Here are details from the story. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'
20691,8,1,1,Paul relizes that he is not alone and has a coach who delt with the same things as he currently is. Paul is suprised when he first finds out and then when Mr. Leonard tells him more of the story he understands why he is helping him.
20692,8,2,2,"When Paul recieves the informaton on Mr. Leonard, he feels as if he is in the same boat as him. Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before. In the story, Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes. But after he finds out that he can't read, he wants to start training Mr. Leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for Paul during the track season."
20693,8,1,2,Paul learned beckground information about Mr. Leonard that was revelant to his own life. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler but was awful at reading. Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard failed out of college for not being able to read. Paul knows that he is not very good at reading and being in this remedial program will help him learn to read better and maybe one day he will go to college for hurdles but not fail out.
20694,8,0,0,It makes Paul curious. You can tell this because he asks Mr. Leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him. Another reason you can tell it makes him curious is because Paul asks other questions about Mr.Leonards past like 'What Happened.'
20695,8,0,0,It makes paul ask why Mr. Leonard did not tell him this
20696,8,0,2,"Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard because he has the same problems as him. At the end of the story, Paul says to Mr. Leonard, indirectly, that he was going to help him learn how to read."
20697,8,2,2,"Paul sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete, but his athletic career was takin away from him because of his grades. Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college. Paul is intrigued to hear this and it makes him want to do better as a student and as an athlete."
20698,8,1,1,"Before Paul knew of Mr. Leonards disability he had just thought of him as some one who didnt know what they were talking about. That Mr. Leonard didnt really understand who Paul was and didnt understnd Pauls' disabilities.            After reading the passage Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had full empathy for him and uunderstood Paul to the fullest. Mr. Leonard then had a bigger empact on Paul because now Paul sees what he can become,and what he has to do to become whatver it is that he wants."
20699,8,1,1,I believe that the information that he learns about Mr. Leonard makes him have a very close connection with him. He realizes that his life is a lot like Mr. Leonard's life but that he has a chance to change his future.

20704,8,2,2,"Paul finds reading hard; so does Mr. Leonard. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but couldn't read, this reminded him that he couldn't read. If Mr. Leonard could read, but can be a track star, then Paul can work on his reading and become a track star. Mr. Leonard's history shows Pail what he can become."
20705,8,1,2,It gives Paul modivation to excel in the hurdles and also to help Mr. Leonard in areas he struggled with to.  The background information also gives Paul a feeling of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer everyone else knew.  He then realizes that Mr. Leonard is helping him to excel in something to make him feel important.

20712,8,2,1,He is shocked and can't believe he was in college for hurdles. Also he didn't know why he didnt tell him before.' why didnt you tell me about this before?'
20713,8,0,0,"That Mr. Leonard was a Collage track super star and he broke records. It had a negative and a postive effect on Paul. It put him down that the man who had been helping him had not told him that he was a track star, but it also helped him when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it."
20714,8,2,2,"When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him.

20721,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but poor student. His college work was harder than high school work, so he lost his scolarship and dropped out. He said the coach did not want a runner that could not read."
20722,8,0,0,He wants to be like Mr. Leonard and be a track star. He wants to be smart and able to read.
20723,8,2,2,In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'. Now the Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant.
20724,8,1,2,"When Paul found out that Mr.Leonard was a good track star and that he didn't go to college because he couldn't read, it reminded Paul of his self."
20725,8,2,1,Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants Paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense. Mr. Leonard also is not good at school like Paul and wants to give Paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for Paul.
20726,8,2,2,"The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was a track star during college, by the URL given to him by the track coach, he acts suprised and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read."
20727,8,1,1,"Paul most likely now understands why Mr. Leonard is encouraging him to do the races, and wants him to go to college and graduate."
20728,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too.
20729,8,2,2,The background information about Mr.Leonard effects Paul by showing him and inspiring him with a story that is somewhat similar to his own. He knows that Mr.Leonard and himself have things incommon. They are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles.
20730,8,1,1,"Paul understood better why Mr. Leonard took care of Paul. When Paul told Mr. Leonard he couldn't read, that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star. With this back ground information, Paul felt more emotionally connected to Mr. Leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life. He felt like there was someone else out there, and this man was just trying to help Paul succeed at something."
20731,8,1,1,"The background information has a big effect on Paul. It motivates Paul to do even better, since him and Mr. Leonard had similar problems in school."
20732,8,1,1,The background information that Mr. Leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him. It would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track.
20733,8,2,2,The effect that background information has on Paul is that he now feels connected to Mr. Leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good. Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read.
20734,8,1,2,The information he finds about Mr. Leonard effects him alot because he relizes how much they are alike to eachother. They both have reading disabilities and he is trying to help him to get over that and not to affect him. Mr. Leonard gets him on the track and trains him because that is what he used to do and he wants to pass it on.
20735,8,2,2,Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.' Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college.
20736,8,2,0,"He realizes the importance of working hard, learning to read and doing well in school. He handed the print out of the web page to Mr. Leonard and ask him what happened to him and Mr. Leonard told him his story. At that moment Paul realized that reading and graddes were important and Mr. Leonard didn't want him to suffer the same way he did."
20737,8,1,1,"I believe that gives Paul, the narrator, and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to Paul it's someone he can look at and understand. It gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others. He is not alone. It also tells Paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading. That is why i believe that it gives background information."
20738,8,0,0,PAUL SEES THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU CANT DO SOMETHING RIGHT YOU CAN WORK HARD TO OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE.
20739,8,1,1,Mr. Leonard asking the narrator has set Paul into the right frame of mind by knowing that life always has obstacles. Paul also relized that Mr. Leonard was always there to help and making Paul motivated to read. Everyone knows that reading is something you need to do not maybe want to do.
20740,8,1,0,Paul realized that even though your not good at one thing that you can't be good at something else. Just like when Paul talks about he knows the feeling of embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he did'nt know an anwser everyone else knew. Paul realized Mr. Leonard gave his time to help him excel at something and that its okay to not be good at something you just have to work at it harder.
20741,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's past motivates Paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'"
20742,8,0,1,The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.
20743,8,1,2,It reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college and since Paul can't read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college.
20744,8,2,2,He finds out that Mr. Leonard and Paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self.
20745,8,0,0,Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star yet flunked out of collage because he couldnt read. 'no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.'
20746,8,0,0,he got upset cause he never told him
20747,8,2,2,"Before learning of Mr. Leonard's background, Paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read.  Once Mr. Leonard gets Paul running track and builds his confidence Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to be a track star.  When Paul questions Mr. Leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year, due to reading and homework troubles.  Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'  He also learns that just because he struggles in school doesn't mean he can't succeed with his dreams; he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor."
20748,8,1,1,"Paul actually wants to do this now that he knows Mr. Leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college. An example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me . I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him."
20749,8,0,0,The efect that Mr. Leonards has on Paul is that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard and he does not want to take the same route as Mr. Leonard and ruin the chances of having something good going for him.
20750,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is interested and wants to know more. Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' is what went through his mind. This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read."
20751,8,2,2,"Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team. It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, he felt as though he should give back. After the story ends, it's clear that Paul is helping to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself."
20752,8,1,1,He was amazed by his accomplishments and wondered why even though he went to college he had problems with school work.
20753,8,0,0,M.r. Leonard feel s that paul is just like him in ways.  He couldnt read so he had to flunk out of college and he didnt want that to happen to paul.
20754,8,1,1,"It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul."
20755,8,0,0,It makes him feel discouraged and angry. Paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do.
20756,8,0,0,The effect on the background that he has on Paul was because on lines 3 and 4 Mr.Leonard talks and says 'Hey my friend where do you think you are going' Then Paul says the 'Learning Center' then he tells him that he can't read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story.
20757,8,2,2,"The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence. Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students."
20758,8,1,2,"Mr. Leonard was a big time runner in his college days, but was unable to learn anything while in college. As a result Mr. Leonard was thrown out of college and no other school would take him, because even though he was a good runner he wasn't well educated which was not tolerated. This is seen as a big incouragement for Paul, seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education, that he can accomplish things when he tries. Also Paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make Mr. Leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what Leonard couldn't."
20759,8,2,2,"Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard, because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed. For example in the story the author stated ' I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when i idin't know an answer everyone else knew.' This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt. Therefore, Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background."
20760,8,1,0,Paul is concerned about Mr. leonard that why didn't he finish college and why didn't he tell him that he was a star athlete on hurdlers
20761,8,0,0,Paul likes to incourage people to do better.
20762,8,2,2,"As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor. This made Paul respectful and obedient to him. That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics. The next peice of backround information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard, is that Mr. Leonard was a track star. This simply increases the respect he has for him. In the story, Paul didn't appear to be upset that Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past, he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more. The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he couldn't read. Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate, but Paul can simpathize. He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read."
20763,8,1,1,"During this story, Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard that really surprises him. This information shows Paul that even though you may be good at something, for example a sport, school work and your education always comes first. Now, Paul will really work hard on learning how to read. He doesn't want to let Mr. Leonard, or himself down."
20764,8,0,0,"The background information has a huge affect on Paul because Mr. Leonard was trying to help Paul be as good as he was at hurdles.  Mr. Leonard wanted someone that never did anything and was working hard for his grades.When Mr. Leonard found out that Paul was learning how to read, Mr. Leonard took that as an oppurtunity to help Paul achieve in something that he once had."
20765,8,1,2,Paul doesn't feel as embarrased to know his coach struggled with reading too.
20766,8,2,2,"Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past. He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name. When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened, he felt for  him. Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills."
20767,8,2,1,"When Paul realizes that his everyday coach and hall monitor was truely a great college track runner, Paul was stunned. Paul had been interacting with Mr. Leaonard everyday without knowing his true background. Paul is surprised about Mr. Leonard's background and then goes on to ask him various questions."
20768,8,2,0,The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard gives him a curious feeling. He wondered what happened to Mr. Leonard. As it turns out Mr. Leonard can't read which is the same problem that Paul had which caused the two to meet. Since Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run hurdles Paul felt he should teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20769,8,1,0,The effect on Paul from raeding Mrs. Leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education. Because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it.
20770,8,2,2,HE it makes him like Mr. Leonard more. When he finds out that he was a track star and very good he shows the coach more understanding as to why he made him do track. When he learns that Mr. Leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him.
20771,8,1,1,It has a positive effect on Paul. It makes him want to strive to be better than Mr. Leonard.
20772,8,1,2,The information he fount on Mr. Leonard had a good effect on Paul because he didnt know Mr.Leonard ran track in his freshmen year in college. He was inspired by it and the fact that Mr.Leonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education.
20773,8,2,2,"Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard. They both can't, or have trouble, reading. Plus they are both track hurdlers too. Therefore when he (Paul) learns of Mr. Leonard's past he feels a relation between them."
20774,8,0,1,"He isn't really affected by it.  He was just curious as to why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about it.  Paul may have been a little hurt, but I don't think it really surprised him that much.  Paul was understanding when Mr. Leonard told him why, and wanted to help him."
20775,8,1,2,Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
20776,8,0,0,Mr Leonard did a great job when he was on track. But became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read. He later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read. He explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up. And he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs.
20777,8,2,2,"Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past from the high school track coach.  He is surprised by the janitor's previous experiences.  You know that he surprised because, he confronts him about it.  When he finds out Grabowski can not read he feels the need to help he shows that by tellinghim it is time to start training you."
20778,8,2,1,"It surprises him, but he is more determined to help Mr. Leonard and do better himself. Paul sees the person that helped him not do so well in school so it would shock and surprise him. He is more determined to help Mr. Leonard out since Mr. Leonard helped him out. He knows what Mr. Leonard feels like since he has gone through some of the same situations."
20779,8,1,1,Pauls more aprehensive to learn. Hes confident that learning to read will be easier now because if tracks easy then so is school. And it theres people like him then hes not so ashamed.
20780,8,2,2,"Paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete. When he found out that Mr. Leonard also couldn't read, he understood how his coach felt. He also felt that he owed Mr. Leonard something for teaching him how to run hurdles, so he offered to help the coach with reading."
20781,8,0,0,Paul wants to learn how to run faster for the high school track. and he run every day with Mr. Leonard and Mr.Leonard wants to lit him tran for high school because he will be good and faster they another kis. Mr.leonard shows the boy something how to stay and shape.

20784,8,2,1,"I believe that when Paul knows the truth about Mr. Leonard, he is more motivated to start learning and willing to work harder on hurdling. His relationship with Mr. Leonard also increases and he comes to respect him."
20785,8,0,0,Well Mr Leonard was Paul Teacher and everybody would always make fun of him because he wasnt good at sports or anything so his teacher decides to put me in sports like basketball and track he would like jump over the hurdles like it wasnt nothing and his coach was like nice job kid i hope you do good when your playing baskaetball so he lefted english to go to a learning center to get helped and work out for the basketball and track and everybody that was in the school were like good job kid im proud of you so then the kids were jealous and mad because he would do something right that his coach would tell me
20786,8,0,1,The background information helps Paul acheive his goals. Paul took his training lessons from Mr. Leonard and became good at doing the hurdles in track. Even though Paul couldn't read he still wanted to do few things to accomplish in his life. He may of been going into the Learning Center but that doesn't stop you from doing well in other acheivements. Paul learned alot from his coach and taught him how to be better than what Paul had realized he was.
20787,8,2,2,The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul. Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both can't read. Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles.
20788,8,1,1,"Paul was surprised, and kind of angry that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him sooner."
20789,8,2,2,The narrator is surprised at the information. He never expected that Mr. Leonard was a track star.
20790,8,1,1,The background information that Paul finds out helps Paul know that he can become an athlete too. It also proves that Paul can go to college even though he can't read. Mr. Leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldn't read.
20791,8,0,0,When paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. leonard. Paul wondered
20792,8,2,2,"Because Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had been a great athlete, but flunked out of school because he was unable to read, he had common ground built with Mr. Leonard. That knowledge of what had happened to Mr. Leonard impacted Paul to start working harder, because Mr. Leonard had told him how hard things got after high school."
20793,8,2,2,Mr.Lenorad lets Paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read. This effects Paul because he is in the same situation at school because he cant read as well but Mr. Leonards lets him know thats not a problem because Paul has help that mr. leonard didnt have.
20794,8,2,1,Paul comes to find out that Mr.Leonard and himself are the same. They both struggle with reading in high school and in high school is when they found that they love track.
20795,8,0,0,Paul can't believe that Mr. Leonard was a college tract runner. He wants to know why Mr. Leonard didn;t tell him.
20796,8,2,2,"During the story, when Paul confronts Mr. Leonard about his past, it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated.  Mr. Leonard too could not read.  The embarassing emotions that Mr. Leonard felt were all too familiar to Paul and gave him a sense of not being alone.  The effect that this information had on Paul was substantial, because it motivated Paul to become a better reader and athlete, not just for his sake, but for Mr Leonard's sake as well."
20797,8,2,2,"Teh background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by making him realize that other people also share his troubles of not being able to read, even great athletes like Mr. Leonard."
20798,8,1,1,The imformation that Paul get on Mr. Leonard helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him with track.
20799,8,0,1,He wants him to be as good as he can be for the sport that he is going out for and learn as much as he can to be prepared for what he is about to get into he is going out for training to get as good as he can at it
20800,8,2,1,"When Paul learns of Mr. Loenard's past, it might have had a positive emotional affect on himself. Paul says in the story that he is a select few who are in the remedial reading program, and from this he may feel embarrased and have low self-esteem. Plus, when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesn't help his esteem either. But when learns of Mr. Leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school, this may motivate Paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what Mr. Leonard could not accomplish."
20801,8,1,1,"Paul realizes Mr. Leonard and him are similiar. Paul realizes he doesn't have to be the last person picked in the gym anymore and he can achieve something, and there is hope that he will learn to read and become a great athlete."
20802,8,0,1,"He realizes that even if he is not good in school he can still succeed in life. He finds that he just has to find something he is good at, stick with it, and succeed."
20803,8,2,2,"The effect that it has on Paul is that he now feels the desire to help out Mr. Leonard since he had takent the time to help him out.  In the story it says, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'  This show how he felt the need to return the help."
20804,8,0,0,Leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times. He never gave up. Paul learned alot from him and he used that in life.
20805,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonards background information gives Paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read. It also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since Mr. Leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school. When Paul realizes how much Mr. Leonard and him have in common, it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life.     Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read."
20806,8,0,0,he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state.
20807,8,2,2,"Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track. He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles. However, he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college. Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center. Mr. Leonard's school had not had a learning center, so he never got help with his reading problems. He had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems. This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring."
20808,8,2,2,"When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking."
20809,8,1,2,"Mr. Leonard's background information had an effect on Paul because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had the same problem and motivation. Their problem was that both were not very strong at reading, but their strengths, hurdles, is what brought the two together as friends. Since Mr. Leonard had the motivation to teach Paul hurdles, and Paul was willing to learn, Paul could become the new Mr. Leonard, athletically."
20810,8,2,2,"He learns that Mr. Leonard is very much like him in the sense that Mr. Leonard isn't a good reader either.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track, even though he was not that good in school.  When he explained to Paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college, it helped Paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school, but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal.  With Mr. Leonard showing Paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles, Paul was able to apply Mr. Leonard's advice to his own life."
20811,8,2,1,The effect of the background information on Paul is a good thing. The background information makes Paul open his eyes and realize what Mr. Leonard was doing for him. Mr. Leonard did not know how to read and when he found out that Paul did not know how to read he eased up on him. Mr. Leonard coaches Paul how to do hurdles Mr. Leonard sees himself in Paul and knows it is a great thing for him.
20812,8,0,0,"When Paul recieves background information about Mr.Leonard, they become more familiar with eachother. Paul Has an inferrior and shy complex as he first interacts with Mr.Leonard. He obeys the comands form his hall monitor, but there was no relationship formed. When Mr.Leonard introduces himself as a concerned adult, Paul still looks up to him. After a relationship is formed with common character traits, and the two characters become on the same level of understanding."
20813,8,0,1,"Paul receives information about Mr. Leonard after training with him for some time. After receiving the information, however, Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard wants to help him. Mr. Leonard inspires him to do his best. He sees that having the learning center and trying hard, along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish. He wants to overcome this task though."
20814,8,2,2,"Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star as a college freshman. However, because Mr. Leonard struggled with reading and academics, he lost his scholarship and was forced to drop out of school. The fact that Mr. Leonard also struggles academically helps Paul to relate to him. It gives Paul the confidence to embark on a friendship where he and Mr. Leanard can help each other succeed."
20815,8,1,1,"Over the course of Paul's encounters with Mr. Leonard, various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner. Its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help Paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14-23, 'Know what that...Right', I panted'.     The greatest revealation, however, is made when Paul obtains information on Mr. Leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32-33, ' 'Visit this site...with the team'.

20816,8,2,2,"Paul gets backgroung information abuot Mr. Leonard and effects Paul because he didn't know that Leonard was a hurdle athlete.

Paul works hard to and, gets help after school also, going to the learning center for help.      Mr. Leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here Pauls age. They didnt have a learning center for him. Mr. Leonard had to go to his friends for help.     This showed Paul that he can do it if Mr. Leonard did. He will just have to work hard at school work and track."
20819,8,1,1,The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program. Paul is then very empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and is probably going to try teach him.

20830,8,2,2,that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college.

20836,8,2,2,The eefect the background information that paul found on Mr. Leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldn't read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read.
20837,8,0,0,"That why would he be teaching him how to run the hurdles if he was so good and also to ask him why he is the hall monitor for the school, not a track star person."
20838,8,2,2,"Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought. When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul becomes more motivated. This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team.

Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school."
20842,8,2,2,"Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative.

20847,8,2,1,"The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic. Paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler. Also Paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports. On the other hand, Paul was sympathetic for Mr. Leonard for what had happened to him. For example Paul asked, ' Well, what happened after that.' That shows he was curious and cared."
20848,8,1,1,The background infromation shows paul that he can learn how to read. that if he puts his mind to something he can succsed if he tries.
20849,8,1,0,its the fact that they both cant read.

20853,8,1,1,There is a simlairies that Mr.Leonard shaw potential in Paul and wanted Paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so Paul wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard.

20856,8,1,1,"Seeing that Mr. Leonard had been capable of not only going to college, but braking records in the 400 meter hurdles, influenced him. Paul seen that Mr. Leonard accomplished amazing things in life, and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldn't read, influenced Paul even more. Paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles, so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college because he couldn't read."
20857,8,1,1,"The narrator is, in a way, just like Mr. Leonard. He will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college."

20859,8,2,2,"The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles.

Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read."
20860,8,2,2,"Paul receives a URL containing information about Mr. Leonard's past as a track star. This shocked Paul at first and made him wonder why Mr. Leonard kept this from him. He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read, just like himself. This made Paul feel like he isn't such a failure at life after all, because he is now good at track and field as well as has the ability to use a learning center to learn how to read."
20861,8,0,0,It gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory. Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.

This also gave him better understanding of Mr. Leonard's life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity, and Paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with hurrdles."
20864,8,2,2,An example from the story that tells Paul some background information about Mr. Leonard is when Paul gets on the track and field website thats says Mr. Leonard was a college track star. It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner. Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.
20865,8,2,2,Paul is surprised about the background information.  He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records.  He wants to know more about him.
20866,8,0,1,The information that Mr. Leonard provides has a great effect on Paul. As he is telling Paul about his past it reminds him of himself because he is the same way and wants to change his ways and bcome an achiever in life. He also wants to make Mr. Leonard happy by doing track and field.
20867,8,2,1,When Mr. Leonard explained to Paul that he had also struggled in life with reading disablities. Then Paul relized that he was suffering the same thing and why he has to go to the learning center to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard didn't have much of a way to learn how to read in school. He had no learning centers but in collage he had tutors that ried to help him. But the collage was to hard so he dropped out. When told that to Paul the young man noticed that it sounded just like him.
20868,8,2,2,"I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher. Little did Paul know, but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner.

Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him."
20871,8,2,2,Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
20872,8,2,2,"The backround story you get on Mr. Leonard is that he was a good athlete, but he was not a good student. College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read."

20874,8,2,2,"Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties. He also most likely understands that, had he been born in an earlier age, he may have had the same college experience as Mr. Leonard.

20875,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read, and the school work was too challenging. No school would take a runner who couldn't read. After Paul learned all of this information, he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat. He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer. Paul was very grateful and shocked that Mr. Leonard gave up his time to help Paul succeed, and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication."
20876,8,1,1,that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr. leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show Mr. Leonard he can do it
20877,8,0,0,"The effect it had on Paul was that basically he could be a great athlete but he would have to have his grades right also.He was a college freshmen who won the 40 meter hurdkes at nationals, but he couldnt read."
20878,8,2,2,Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20879,8,1,1,Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
20880,8,2,2,"When he learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star, Paul is slightly unhappy that he wasn't told. He even asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell Paul.

20884,8,1,0,"The effect the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard in the story is that Paul has the same problems Paul had but Paul is getting help with it and Paul never was interested in sports but Mr. Leonard was and he was good at them too. So since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul would help him."
20885,8,2,2,"The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did."

20888,8,2,1,"When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard he was surprised. Since he found out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but not a good student, he felt good for learning to read.

20889,8,1,1,"Paul feels sorry for Mr. Leonard, because he understands and can relate to how he feels. Mr. Leonard's past of 'feelings of embarrassment,' were Paul's present life."
20890,8,0,0,Paul was a guy who felt neglected and was always picked last and Mr. Leonard picked up on it.  He knows what it is like to feel embarrassed to not be able to do something because he flunked out of college.  He motivated Paul to do hurdles and showed him how they are obstacles in life. He also found that he was not good at reading either so he was concerned and wanted to help.

20893,8,2,2,"Paul is amazed at the achievments of Mr. Leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent. In line 40, Paul asks 'Well, what happened after that.' This shows that, at the time, Paul didnt understand why Mr. Leonard didn't pursue track and field. Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate. He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle."
20894,8,2,2,"The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training."
20895,8,0,0,"It didn't occured to the narrator at first when Mr. Leonard asked him for his name, but later the narrator realized that it was an odd question because Mr. Leonard checked the narrator's hall pass, which had his name on it, twice every week.

The narrator was curious about what had happened to Mr. Leonard after his broken record as a college freshman.

20909,8,2,2,"The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard. Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler. It made him feel kind of good to know that Mr. Leonard was a hurtler, adn that Mr. Leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this.

20916,8,2,2,It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul. He didin't know how to read and he was only good at track. When Paul learns he can't read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles.
20917,8,2,2,"Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard, he is encouraged, almost dumbfounded. Paul is shocked because he can't believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker. Paul is proud of Mr. Leonard, but also confused as to why Mr. Leonard did not go onto bigger and better things. Paul states, 'You were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'(paragraph 38).  He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?'(paragraph 40). This show Paul's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things."
20918,8,2,0,"The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard I think has made Paul not be ashamed that he is getting help. Mr. Leonard told Paul 'I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This shows Paul that he should get help with things now, so that in the future he won't rely on other people, like friends, to get him by in college, and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out."
20919,8,1,0,It shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up. That he should always try his best and to try different things.
20920,8,1,1,Paul is shocked to hear that Mr Leonard was in track an never told anyone
20921,8,1,1,The background information helped paul see why its important to try in school. It also got him motivated to want to go in track.
20922,8,2,2,It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
20923,8,2,2,Paul was surprised. Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records.
20924,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college."
20925,8,0,0,"When Paul is in school and he has gym class, he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports. He wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything."
20926,8,2,2,"During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading. When he meets Mr. Leonard, Paul becomes motivated by him. By going out for track, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades. Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard. The last paragraph, Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard did for him and wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading."
20927,8,1,1,The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it encourages him to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20928,8,2,2,the effect of the background of Mr Loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background.
20929,8,0,2,The backround information given to Paul was used to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20930,8,1,1,He was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard was a high school track star.
20931,8,1,1,Paul probably feels motivated because he isn't the only one who doesn't know how to read. This motivates him to hurdle.
20932,8,1,1,Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how he ran track in high school.
20933,8,2,2,Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read. But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt. So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading.
20934,8,2,2,When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard run track in college and boke some records he realizes how he know so much about track and understands why he is helping him once he is told about how he flunked out of college.Paul relize that he can help Mr. Leonard to so he returns the favor and helps him with what he struggled with in school.
20935,8,2,2,The background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college. Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20936,8,2,2,Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from.  He  also realized they were similar.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul train for hurtles and Paul decided he could give something in return by teaching Mr. Leonard to read.
20937,8,0,0,"During the story Paul is given a website to look at. While looking at the website, her found out a little history on Mr. Leonard's succes in track and field.      In the hall Paul was stopped by him, he was confused when he found out that he did not know Pauls name."
20938,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard has background infromation he doesn't want to tell Paul because his college sport he played he was disappointed on.
20939,8,2,2,"I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was. He already had respect for Mr. Leonard and did as he was told, but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities. It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well."
20940,8,1,2,"When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he is extremely surprised. Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard hasn't already informed him of his past accomplishments. After all that Mr. Leonard recounted to him, Paul could completely relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul felt like they had a win win friendship because Mr. Leonard had something to offer him and he had something to offer Mr. Leonard."
20941,8,2,2,"The effect it had on Paul was somewhat like the effect Paul had on Mr. Leonard; sympathy. They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarassment when I ws called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul helped Mr. Leonard, just like he had helped Paul."
20942,8,2,2,"The information effects Paul because, he finds out that Mr. Leonard is just like him, he cant read. When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him. And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read. Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him."
20943,8,1,1,"Paul finally understands why Mr. Leonard is interested in him. Paul and Mr. Leonard are alike in a way. They both have problems reading and are good at track. Even though Mr. Leonard is a college flunk out, Paul still feels the same about him if not better."
20944,8,0,0,"The effect it has on Paul, is that he finds out, that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school. And he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through."
20945,8,0,0,he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort. there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best.
20946,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard has kind of the same problems as Paul. Mr. Lenoard was a good athlete, but did poorly in school. He relied on friends to help him get by. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading and fluked out of College because of it."
20947,8,2,2,"'C'mon,Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This statement, made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul made a mental connection with him. They both couldn't read. They had something in common. This new connection lead to Paul being willing to help Mr. Leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another."
20948,8,2,2,"he underwstands why mr. leonard worked with him to do this. mr. leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read, bc they didnt have help centers."
20949,8,0,0,"Paul, was a good athlete, but not a good student. He had no learning centes in school. o relied on friends to help get him by, even thou he worked hard, and went to college."
20950,8,0,0,It effects the story in ways that Mr. Leonard was a phenomenom. He broke many records and the narator was being trained by a star athlete.
20951,8,1,1,"Paul feels horrible about what happened to Mr.Leonard. Paul then feels remorse over the fact Mr.Leonard can't read,and then he relates their problems."
20952,8,0,0,That paul didn't really know about sports that well. So he didn't know about Mr. Leonard at all which made Mr. Leonard not tell hima bout his past when he was in college.
20953,8,1,1,"It encourages him to do his best, therefor he goes to the track meets and is going to compete."
20954,8,2,2,"The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model. Paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes Paul feel like he can help him just like Mr. Leonard helped him with hurtles."
20955,8,0,0,Paul reminded Mr. Leonard about his college days. Paul is one of Leonards best hurdlers.
20956,8,2,2,"After the realization of Mr. Leonard's past, Paul wanted to help him. Paul saw that Mr. Leonard was sad, and a little regretful, about flunking out of college so he wanted to teach him. Mr. Leonard had assisted Paul, and now Paul wanted to assist Mr. Leonard by tutorong him in Reading/Comprehension."
20957,8,2,2,"Paul and Mr. Loenard both have the same thing in commom, they both do not know how to read.  Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class. But after a while of talking to Mr. Leonard, Paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete. Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination."
20958,8,0,0,The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Mr. Leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed.

I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew'
20959,8,0,0,"In the beginning of the story, Paul tells the reader that he cannot read. When Mr. Leonard tells Paul to stay after one day and showed him the basketball team, Paul tells the reader that he is always the last guy choosen in gym class and doesn't want more of that treatment. Then when Mr. Leonard tells Paul to run, Paul doesn't disobey because he is just use to doing as he is told. Throughtout the story, with Mr. Leonard's help, Paul becomes great at track. Upon finding out that Mr. Leonard cannot read, Paul decides that is it time to gave back to the man who made him a fast runner."
20960,8,2,2,"The effect it has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read. Paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help, unlike Mr. Leonard."
20961,8,2,2,"From the way that Paul responded from the information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him. Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul, i think Paul understood more. I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common. Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles. Towards the end of the story it makes them closer."
20962,8,0,0,"The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center."

20965,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read, he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him. Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at track and in return Paul said he would help him learn to read."
20966,8,0,0,It gives Paul more knowledge on Mr. Leonard. It also makes him more confident in letting Mr. Leonard coach him.
20967,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something. When he questions him, and finds out the truth, he says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.'"
20968,8,2,2,"All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school.

Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike."
20969,8,1,1,"The information about Mr. Leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor, he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible, just like Mr. Leonard."
20970,8,2,2,Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr.  Leonard. Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete. Paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the school's learning center and disovers that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities. This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader.
20971,8,2,2,"After Paul listend to Mr. Leonard's story about his college experience, it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do. Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back, not with money but with knowledge. At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard that 'It's time to start your trainging', meaning its time to learn to read."
20972,8,2,2,It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read.
20973,8,0,0,The effect that the background information has on Paul is that
20974,8,0,0,Because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you. Another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass. Also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going. The coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it. Then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for Paul. Also Paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training.
20975,8,1,0,The effect the information had on Paul about Mr. Leonard was that Paul was not the most intelligent kid and neither was Mr. Leonard back in his day. Paul realized even though you do poor in something doesn't mean you can't still susceed. Mr. Leonard wanted to have Paul realize that he's not the only one in the situation he's in.
20976,8,0,0,"The background check on Paul would be about the same as Mr. Leonard, becasue he was very good at track and field but, he couldn't read. He wanted to help Paul get better at track and field and much better at reading. he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field."
20977,8,2,2,"The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard  had on Paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in.

Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul because he felt grateful toward him. So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read."
20978,8,1,2,"Paul is kind of affended that Mr. Leonard never told him because he says, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' After he found out the whole truth behind the story he had sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul is in the same struggle and can relate. He feels for Leonard because he lost his future all because he couldn't do something as simple as read but it also made him realize that he is in a struggle against reading and school too and if he doesn't over come his obstacle his future at hurdles could end like Mr. Leonards... or simply never start."
20979,8,2,2,"When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul."
20980,8,2,2,"When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read, he understands Mr. Leonard's feelings about flunking out of college. Paul also knows why he was asked what his name was even tho Mr. Leonard sees his pass every day. It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul so much, he wanted to return the favor and invited Mr. Leonard to his study group."
20981,8,2,2,"Paul learns that Mr. Leonard never learned hwo to read, and Paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school. He connects with Mr. Leonard, as mentioned in paragraph 45, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud...' and understands who Mr. Leonard feels.     After learned about Mr. Leonard's history, Paul looks back on the days that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read."
20982,8,1,1,The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he is suprised at Mr. Leonard's achievements in college and how he is just a hall moniter in school after achieving greatness.
20983,8,0,0,"He want's to do better at reading things, and Mr.Leonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did. When he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did."
20984,8,2,2,At frist Paul is pround for Mr. leonard because he broke records in collage. But then when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading. Paul felt sympathic. And realized since Mr.Leonard helped him that he could help read better.
20985,8,0,1,It makes Paul feel better about himself. He feels that way because he realizes that maybe he could actually excel at something. That he could actually be good at something and not feel like he is left out. Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was in a way like him. I think Paul gained some confidence discovering Mr. Leonard's past.

20995,8,2,2,"Paul discovers the truth about Mr. Leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation. When Mr. Leonard first tells Paul about what he used to be, Paul was filled with unbelief.

20996,8,0,0,"He told him to meet him at 2:30pm. Then with all the trainning. He eneded up telling him that he was in high school and ran track. And ended up going to collage and droped out cause, the school didnt want some kid that couldnt read."

21017,8,2,2,"The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has a huge effect on Paul because he has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles, and so is Paul. Mr. Leonard also does not know how to read, and that is what Paul has troubles with and is trying to fix. The information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to strive more for what he could have."
21018,8,0,0,"The effect that background information has on Paul is that Paul can't read and when mr. Leonard was younger he flunked out of college and didn't want Paul to flunk, so he pushed him."
21019,8,1,1,"The background infromation on Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it helps Paul realize that he and Leonard have the same problem. They both dont want to be embarrassed by the mistakes they make. Paul with problem at reading and Leonard with his drop out history, but this also helps Paul by giving him the courage to get past his problem. Thats how the background information effects Paul."
21020,8,0,0,Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete when he was younger.  He is a bit disappointed that Mr. Leonard never told him about his college track success.  In the last paragraph it shows that Paul and Mr. Leonard end up switching roles because of the information.
21021,8,0,0,When Paul knows about Mr. Leonard's
21022,8,1,0,I think that it helps him alot because he now knows that the coach was ding what he knew trying to help the kid on something that he could not accomplish himself.
21023,8,2,2,"In the story, the reader is told of Mr. Leonard's achievements in track and his failures as a student. It is said that although he was able to win and set records nationally, he wasnt able to pursue this track career because he couldn't maintain his grades. Through learning this, Paul is able to empathize. He can relate to Mr. Leonard's struggles and take that to know that he was not just the child with a learning disability, but also the child with potential in his seemingly-dissapointing life."
21024,8,2,2,"Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling. Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer. He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does. Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading."
21025,8,0,0,He gets information about him when he dont need it so he takes offense to it.
21026,8,1,1,This effect Paul by making him inspired that the coach would take time out for him and lend him some advice.
21027,8,0,0,That Mr. Leonard was a great athlete and he knew that he could achieve and also be a great athlete if he kept practicing and kept training.
21028,8,1,1,"It makes Paul finally realize why Mr. Leonard is helping him.  They relate in a way that Paul could never imagine, and Mr. Leonard is only trying to help."
21029,8,2,2,Paul feels that he understand's Mr. Leonard better because he knows what it is like to not be able to read.  This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21030,8,2,2,"When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star he wonders why he isn't anymore. When Mr. Leonard tells him that he flunked out of his scholarship, Paul is very empathetic to him because he knows how Mr. Leonard feels. When Paul finds out about all of this, he wants to help Mr. Leonard."
21031,8,0,0,... I don't know
21032,8,1,1,The effect it has on Paul is it shows him that if he works hard anything is possible.
21033,8,2,1,"By learning about Mr. Leonards's past, Paul feels motivated to overcome the dificulties that are ahead of him. Paul feels that he should work harder on everything in his life after discovering Mr. Leonard's career in college track."
21034,8,0,0,Paul finds out that that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he was in high school and got a scholar sship for college but he couldnt read so they had to take him out.
21035,8,2,2,"When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he becomes sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard's reading difficulties, which Paul also has. This sympathy is expressed when Paul tells Mr. Leonard that: 'It's time to start [his] training.' This meaning that Paul is trying to help Mr. Leonard overcome his problems."
21036,8,2,2,"The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read.  Also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him.  Knowing this information, it had a great effect on Paul.  Now that Paul knew this he was more determined to excel in school and do well, and also find something he likes and excel in that, like the hurdles and track."
21037,8,0,1,The information he found effected him in a good way. It made him feel better about the fact that he couldn't read. He found out that he wasn't the only one out there that couldn't read and it gave him more reasons to keep going to the learning center to get better at reading. It was the extra push to keep him going.
21038,8,1,1,"After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, Paul seems to be able to identify more with him. He seems to feel closer to Mr. Leonard and wants to help him too. He also realizes why Mr. Leonard did what he did to help Paul."
21039,8,0,0,paul like the information because it information that he would not have had on his trainer if he had not asked
21040,8,2,2,"In 'Gifts' Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard.  Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an award winning track star at his college, but flunked out and lost his scholarship when he had a difficult time reading.  Paul responds by feeling more of a connection to Mr. Leonard.  Paul then feels motivated to 'train' Mr. Leonard in reading."
21041,8,0,0,Back when he was in collage he was a track star. He wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work. Even then the school work was to hard for him. He lost his scholarship and flunked out of school.
21042,8,0,0,Mr. Lenonard was a great athlete in track and field. In school he had trouble in reading but he got help from a learning place. Then he went to college and aslo got help.
21043,8,2,2,"The background information makes Paul puzzled.  Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret.  When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out of college, Paul understood why he kept it a secret."
21044,8,2,2,The background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects Paul by giving him motivation.  Since Mr. Leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach Paul how to be a successful runner as well.  Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard.
21045,8,1,2,"After Mr. Lenonard told his story to Paul, Paul realized that acdemic learning is more important than sports. He has to participate in his school work. Because no matter how good Mr. Lenorad was, his college still lost his scholarship and flunkes out. It is important to learn in schools."
21046,8,1,1,"The effect of Mr. Leonard background information doesn't bother Paul that much. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track and field star, he makes connections. In paragraph 35, Paul is alittle upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his amazing college career. But in paragraph 45, when Paul realizes that him and Mr. Leonard are very much alike, he is happy and wants to give back to Mr. Leonard."
21047,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was illeterate, he understands that he should help him read, just as Mr. Leonard was helping him in track. This is implied in paragraph 46, when the narrator tells Mr. Leonard it is time for his 'training,' which means the narrator will help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read."
21048,8,2,2,"The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul. The information inspires Paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard, although not able to read, was successful at other things including track. By Paul learning of Mr. Leonard's past, he feels more accepted and normal."
21049,8,0,0,"The background information on Mr. Leonard had an effect on Paul because, he seemed anxious to know why Mr. Leonard didn't hurdle anymore and what had happened."
21050,8,2,1,"Mr. Leonard and Paul are two characters that are quite similar. In the story, it says that both characters had a very hard time reading and they are both athletic. So Mr. Leonard's effect on Paul is motivational. He wants Paul to not repeat Mr. Leonard's past and instead push on and be the best he can be."
21051,8,2,2,The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well. The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class. He knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something. Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
21052,8,2,2,"Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records."
21053,8,1,1,"Paul is suspicious on why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about his past. He questions him on why he didn't tell him about his track records in college. Then Mr. Leonard tells him he flunked out because he couldn't read. Paul gets influeced by this to teach Mr. Leonard to read, because Mr. Leonard influenced him to run hurdles."
21054,8,1,1,"Background has an effect on Paul including encouragement and confidence.  Paul tells of how he met Mr. Leonard and how he became close to him.  Later, Paul tells about on the track and because Paul already knows Mr. Leonard, he has confidence in his abilities already.  After the first time around the track, Paul feels discouraged but Mr. Leonard, already being his friend helps to encourage Paul."
21055,8,1,0,The information probaby has a big effect on Paul because Paul can't read either. Paul may feel he can look up to Mr. Leonard and that he is his romodel.
21056,8,2,2,"Paul is empathetic to Mr. Leonard's troubles. Like Paul, Mr. Leonard was poor in school. Paul feels closer to him, saying that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings and words 'were all too familiar'. He realizes then that Mr. Leonard helped him excel in something and offers to help Mr. Leonard excel in something, too."
21057,8,1,2,He felt like they had something incommon. 'I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.'
21058,8,2,2,The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one. It opens Paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second. If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing. This was a huge lesson in Paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals.
21059,8,0,0,it gave him more confidence knowing that Mr. Leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day.
21060,8,2,2,"Paul doesn't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track. He's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before. Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he had never said anything before, and Leonard smiles sadly while he remembers the past. It turns out Mr. Leonard wasn't a good reader either, and flunked out of college. Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard.  Paul then supports him by telling Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'"
21061,8,2,2,"the reader gets background on Mr. Leonard from a track website that the Coach gave him to look up. Paul didn understand why he quiet. but he also didn know that Leonard didn no how to read. Leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes. but college was alot harder and Leonard could not keep up with the school work , so he flunked out. So paul decided to help Leonard to learn how to read, like Loenard helped paul to overcome an obstical."
21062,8,0,0,He fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read. Thats what paul is dong right now is learning how to read and run the hurdles and paul can help his teacher learn how to read.
21063,8,2,2,"When Paul first discovers Mr. Leonard's seemingly glorious past, he is puzzled at the notion that Mr. Leonard would keep that information from him. Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard. Upon doing so, he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only Mr. Leonard, but himself too. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well. Without knowing that Mr. Leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics, Paul would have never had made such a life changing change -- realizing his value."
21064,8,0,0,He wants to help the kid because he is a good boy. and
21065,8,0,0,Paul is mad that someone check's his hall pass twice a week. And he really don't like that becuase they think he is going some where else then where he says he is going so that is way they check his hall pass twice a week.
21066,8,2,2,I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading. Paul felt that Mr. Leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because Paul was having trouble reading as well.
21067,8,0,0,I guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
21068,8,0,0,Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him become great at hurdles. Mr. Leonard knows that Paul had trouble reading but he worked to fix the problem by being in the remedial reading program. Mr. Leonard was fantastic at hurdles in college but he couldn't read so no colleges wanted him to go there. he wanted Paul to be able to be mentally and physically well.
21069,8,0,0,It made people think of him different.
21070,8,1,1,"Paul was shocked, but was feeling not alone. Paul said that Mr. Leonard had givin his time to help him with track and to help him excel at  somthing. It made Paul realise what he could do for Mr. Leonard."
21071,8,2,2,They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
21072,8,0,0,What?
21073,8,0,0,"Paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because Mr. Leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read, and thats what makes him realize."
21074,8,1,1,"By finding information about Mr. Leonard on the internet, It gave Paul the motivation to help Mr. leonard just like Mr. leonard had helped Paul."
21075,8,2,1,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he didn't tell him. He approaches Mr. Leonard about it, and finds out that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul decides he wants to help Mr. Leonard, just as Mr. Leonard helped him."
21076,8,0,1,he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in. he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him. Leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life.
21077,8,2,2,"Paul find out that Mr. Leonard was a good track runner, but not so good at reading. It effected Paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder."
21078,8,0,0,It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
21079,8,1,2,In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him. Paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore. paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it and discovered Mr. Leonard was in the same shoes as Paul was. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was trying to help him.
21080,8,0,1,he had an effect on paul because he tryed so hard to be a good student.
21081,8,1,1,It helps him feel better knowing that he wasn't the only one with the same kind of reading problem.
21082,8,0,0,In highschool Lenard was like Paul not good at school work but a good athletic guy.
21083,8,2,0,He is overwhelmed with who he is talking to and that Mr. Leonard has the same problem he does by not bring able to read. When Paul said ' but you wnet to college.'
21084,8,1,0,The result of the background information is that Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who broke records for the 400 meter hurdles. The impact on Paul is tramendous because he relizes he has a collage all star working with him.
21085,8,0,0,doesnt make sense
21086,8,0,1,They both have the same problem not being able to read and do good in school.
21087,8,2,2,"Paul is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he was a collage freshman. Then, he found out that he had flunked out of college, because he couldn't read. So, Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard."
21088,8,2,2,"In paragraph 5 lines 1-3 when Paul finds that Mr. Leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling: 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called pon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answere everyone else knew.' Then Paul realized he can help Mr. Leonard: ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.''"
21089,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information on Mr. Lenard has on the reader is inspiring to him. Paul finds out that Mr. Lenonard had the same struggles with reading and school work that he has. But he still was an exellent runner, making Paul want to keep at it so that he could be the same way. It was also inspiring because the teacher told him that he flunked out of college because he did not get good grades. That would make Paul want to work harder at his school work, so that the same thing would not happen to him."
21090,8,0,0,"Paul and Mr. Leonard are talkin one day after practice, and Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to a learning center when he was  in high school. Mr Leonard also was an amazing athlete. He did track and field and was very good at it."
21091,8,1,1,That he knows that Mr. Leonard is just like him.
21092,8,2,2,I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21093,8,2,2,"The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring. It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing. Mr. Leonard couldn't read but was excellent at sports, and Paul couldn't read but Mr. Leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldn't be a total 'loser.' Mr. Leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help Paul feel good about himself."
21094,8,0,0,Mrs. Leonard didn't want him to go to the reading center.
21095,8,0,0,That the kid didn't know about mr. leonard.That he ued to run track back in his days as a college student.
21096,8,0,0,"The effect that background information had on Paul was that it made Paul think that Mr. Leonard was a quitter.  Being so good and maybe the best at something, Paul wondered why on Earth would someone quit if they were that good.  If Paul would not have talked to Mr. Leonard about this, he maybe would have quit also."
21097,8,1,0,It tells Paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys.
21098,8,2,2,"Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'"
21099,8,1,2,"Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past. and when Mr.Leonard did he listened to see what he had to say. When Paul heard Mr. Leonard speak and tell his story, he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed. An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard."
21100,8,1,1,When Paul found this information he was shocked that he was hiding something so big like that from him. Paul was confused that a college level athleate was not good in school.
21101,8,1,1,The backround information about Mr. Leonard has a big effect on Paul because Paul understands why Mr. Leonard would want to coach him. It also makes Paul want to work harder for his coach because they have had alot of the same struggles. I also think Mr. Leonard would make Paul better than he was so Paul didnt have some of the same problems he did.
21102,8,2,0,"Paul finds out Mr. Leonard was actually a very good athlete. He went to nationals for track and field and broke records. He also found out Mr. Leonard was not very smart, and that he flunked out of college. This made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard to get back up and get into track and field again. Paul wants to train him now."
21103,8,2,1,Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast. Then he learns about a lot about Mr.Leonard  which I think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend Mr. Leonard.
21104,8,0,0,Paul met Mr. Leonard when i started middle school. He was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving along from one classroom to the next.
21105,8,2,2,Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21106,8,0,0,That infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down. He looks up to Mr. Grabowski and now sees a fall between the two.
21107,8,2,1,The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
21108,8,2,2,"The background infromation that Paul, the narrator, gets in this story is Mr. Leonard was an all-star track runner in high school.  He broke records and got scholarships.  Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard had a hard time comprihending  reading, like himself.  Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well.     Paul knew what it was like for  Mr.Leonard becaue Paul could not read well, nor could he comprihend things easily."
21109,8,1,0,"The reader and Paul share the same mind frame. It states in the article, 'NO other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' They are both very dedicated to their athletics, however, when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future. In the article it states 'I know them well...I didn't know the answer everyone else knew.' When it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker."
21110,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul gathers about Mr. Leonard is that he use to be a college track star.  He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records.  Mr. Leonard then tells him, 'I was a good athlete...but not a good student.  We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.  Luckily, Paul does have those resources and talent, so hopefully he can make it farther than Mr. Leonard."
21111,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard found out Paul failed out of college because he could not read. When Mr. Leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center. By doing a backgroung check he is helping Paul out.
21112,8,2,2,It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
21113,8,0,0,That he was happy to find out what happend to himand what happend after school. Then he was sad to find out that he had droped out of college because that he could not read. After that he found out that it is a ok promble that you can't read  to it is better to try and do not give up at all.
21114,8,0,0,He gets asked about it in the hallway.
21115,8,1,1,"Mr. Leonard shares with Paul that he was a hurderler back in the day. He was a great athlete and even broke records, but then Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his misfortune. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Paul struggles greatly with reading so they both resemble eachother in that aspect. However Paul is in a learning center to get better at it. Mr. Leonard never had that opportunity."
21116,8,0,0,Paragraph 33 (sentence 1). He knows what he is doing.
21117,8,0,0,"Paul realizes that it does not matter wheather you are the best athlete in the world, colleges are looking for an athlete with good educational skills as well."
21118,8,1,1,"The effect it had on Paul was that he was just like him when he was younger. So when Paul saw what he has accomplished, then he feels that he can do this."
21119,8,2,2,"When Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard had a hard time in high school and collage, the narrator learns that Mr. leonard didn't have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days.  Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard, and decided to help him read."
21120,8,0,0,"The author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story. The foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well.       The author begins by introducing Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor. This suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor. When Mr. Leonard ask Paul what his name is in paragraph 24, it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass. Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.      The author's uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know Mr. Leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character Paul."
21121,8,1,1,The background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him and it allows Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return.
21122,8,2,2,"Things were different back then. Mr. Leonard was told that grades didnt matter, that he would have all the help he needed, but that was all a lie. He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul. He was embarrassed when he was called on, or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read. All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact.       Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something. After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him, he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out. Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard."
21123,8,1,1,"it has a lot of effect on him because Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul over come obsticales, and knowing that Mr. Leonard was a national finalist made Paul wonder why he is helping him. then he basicla said that he doesnt want Paul to end up like him and not be able to read. so that probably encouraged {aul to try harder in school and learn to read"
21124,8,2,2,"When Paul first discovers the shocking new information on Mr. Leonard, he is a bit confused. When Mr. Leonard explains fully however, Paul quickly goes from confused to understanding. The way Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes Paul a little emotional. Then, inspired by how Mr. Leonard helped him, despite the troubles he had had himself, Paul decides he wants to return the favor and help out Mr. Leonard."
21125,8,0,0,He is interested in it. Mr.Leonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races. Paul is lucky to have a coach like Mr.leonard.
21126,8,1,0,"Paul and Mr. Leonard are like the same person in this story, only Mr. Leonard has been through the things Paul is going through now and Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through."
21127,8,0,0,It shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasn't able to. He can't read and paul struggles reading.
21128,8,2,2,"It helps Paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem.  He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he (Paul) was feeling.  And, like how Mr. Leonard had helped him, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard."
21129,8,2,1,Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard. He feels the same way as Mr. Leonard did back when he was in high school. Hes going to train him on how to read and Mr. Leonard is goin to trian Paul how to do hurdles.
21130,8,1,1,"It has an effect on Paul because he completely understands what Mr. Leonard has gone through. In a way, he went through the same thing, and it states in the story that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul now has someone that he can connect with. It also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing."
21131,8,2,2,"From the background of Mr. Leonard, Paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either. Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him, he can be just like him. Also, at the end of the story where Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul wants to teach him to read just like Mr. Leonard taught him to run hurdles."
21132,8,1,1,"The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul gets is only a way to motivate him more. He realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading, because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing."
21133,8,1,1,"The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice."
21134,8,0,0,"When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read."
21135,8,2,2,"When Paul prints out that paper on Mr. Leonard he learns that he was the best hurdler in the nation. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Just like Paul couldn't.  Then, Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college. Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle."
21136,8,2,2,"When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track."
21137,8,1,0,the information that paul learns about Mr. Leonared makes paul want to be better in the sport that he wants to be in and try out.
21138,8,2,2,"Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'"
21139,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke."
21140,8,0,1,It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
21141,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard eventually tells Paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was Paul's age. However, he was a good runner. His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles."
21142,8,1,1,"'But you went to college', Paul seems as if he's supprised."
21143,8,1,0,"It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage."
21144,8,1,1,It helps Paul find out who Mr. Leonard is. It also helps him understand how similar each of them are to each other.
21145,8,2,1,He probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school. When he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that Mr. Leonard was in.
21146,8,1,2,"Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles."
21147,8,2,2,"I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners."
21148,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information has on Paul makes him see Mr. Leonard as an inspiration. The information allows Paul to personally see himself in Mr. Leonard and he compares himself to him. For instance, when he reads the information from the website about Mr. Leonard, he is astonished by his accomplishments. Once Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, Paul is inspired by his words. Once the information has sunk in to Paul's mind, he uses Mr. Leonard's story to motivate himselft to be better than Mr. Leonard has turned out to be."
21149,8,2,2,He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
21150,8,1,1,I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
21151,8,2,2,"He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him."
21152,8,2,2,"The effect that the background information that Paul finds on Mr.Leonard is shocking to Paul. He wanted to why Mr.Leonard wouldn't tell him about about Mr.Leonard being the star athelet when he was in high school. When Paul meets up with Mr.Leonard he asks him, ' Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr.Leonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like Paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldn't do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him."
21153,8,2,2,Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21154,8,2,2,"The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read."
21155,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is to try harder. When Paul showed Mr. Leonard that he knew about his times in college, Mr. Leonard told Paul how hard it was"
21156,8,0,1,paul feels just like mr. leonard felt in high school and college.
21157,8,2,2,"The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess."
21158,8,2,2,It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star. It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star.
21159,8,2,2,Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
21160,8,2,2,"Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school."
21161,8,2,2,after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
21162,8,0,0,Paul wants to be like Mr. lenard now. So he askes Mr.lenard about his college track days.
21163,8,2,2,"Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals."
21164,8,2,2,"When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well."
21165,8,0,0,Paul was going to help the teacher with things he needed help on.  he did this by walkin towards the school telling Mr. leonard it was time for his training.
21166,8,0,0,Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.
21167,8,1,1,"When Paul discovered what Mr. Leonard had accomplished in his life, it gave him hope and courage to do the same. He was dtermined to be a better athlete. He wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him."
21168,8,0,0,"Some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete,' he said softly ,' but not a good student. we had ne learning centers in our school. he relied on friends to help him get by."
21169,8,0,1,they are kinda alike in ways because Mr. Leonard cannot read well and neither can Paul.
21170,8,2,1,In the story Paul seemed suprised that Mr. leonard had been a former track runner and that he was good at the hurtles.
21171,8,0,0,Paul thinks the Mr. Leonard is just a hall moniter and paul does not know that Mr. Leonrad had anything to do with being a track star.
21172,8,2,2,The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul. When he finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him.
21173,8,0,0,The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard makes Paul upset. Paul feels sorry curious about it. Paul pointed to the picture and asked Mr. Leonard about it.
21174,8,0,0,"He was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He broke records. He broke records, and he was an eceptional athlete."
21175,8,1,0,Mr. Leonards background information really makes Paul want to join track. Bcause this whole time he was putting his self down and not realizing that it only takes a little talent to become a star Mr. Leonard tells him that he didn't do to well in school and that was something that Paul had incommon with Mr. Leonard and when a teacher or coach can relate to a student or a team member that can bring out the best in a person and make them want to reach there goal faster which is what Paul ends up doing in the story.
21176,8,0,0,"Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'"
21177,8,0,0,Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids.
21178,8,0,0,"In the story it shows that he is a nice guy. But he can be a little bit mean as well too. The effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast. But than he lost his scholarship for college. Due to his grades, even though they told him that they could help him with his grades. But he flunked out anyways."
21179,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard and Paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful.
21180,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again."
21181,8,0,1,"Mr. Leonard reflects who he is now. Paul is watching himself in him, that we should be better than he and make Mr. Leonard happy by giving hima job, to become his coach."
21182,8,0,1,Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college athlete and realises he has a great coach. This helps hm get a chance to work out with the highschool coach.
21183,8,1,1,Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading.
21184,8,2,2,The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that him and Mr. Leonard are very similar because they both had troubles with knowing how to read. Both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read.
21185,8,2,2,"After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read."
21186,8,0,0,he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read
21187,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul. He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read, nobody really helped him. Paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track."
21188,8,2,2,"Paul probably didn't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard. I mean he had some because he never cried and complained, and Mr. Leonard reached out to him. Because of Mr. Leonard, Paul gained respect for himself, and didn't look so down on himself as much.      When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, Paul was shocked it seemed. Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard didn't tell everyone that he broke records. Paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves, but it's their job to find what they are best at."
21189,8,1,0,"The information about Mr. Leomard gets the narrator wondering why if Mr. Leomard was such a good runner, then why is he a school monitor. It makes Paul mysterious about Mr. Leomard in a way also, because Mr. Leonard is too good of an athelete to be a hallway monitor."
21190,8,2,2,"The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him."
21191,8,0,0,The background information uncovered has a positive effect on the relationship between paul and Mr.Leonard. You can tell this by the last line where it is incinuated that after they practice track they will practice reading together.
21192,8,2,2,"The effect the background information ahas in Paul is that when Mr. Leonard was telling Paul all the things that was wrong, it reminded Paul of himself. When Mr. Leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college. Paul got a glimpse of his future. Paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help, so that is why he told Mr. Leonard his training is to begin."
21193,8,1,1,"When Paul gets information about Mr, Leonard from his past he is shocked at first. He is more sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard, so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained Paul. from the passage Paul says to Mr. leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging."
21194,8,2,2,The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading.
21195,8,0,1,"Mr. Leonard is a quiet man about himself and doesn't mention himself or his past much throughout the story. The track coach gives Paul a website to go look up about Mr. Leonard. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a national 400 meter hurdle champion as a freshman in college. Paul wants to know why he didn't keep running throughout college, but then he finds out that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read that well himself and flunked out of college."
21196,8,1,2,"Paul did not know about Mr. Leonard being a track star in high school, so when the track coach gave Paul the website to check out, he asked Mr. leonard why he never told Paul he was a track star. Paul is glad to have a real athlete to help him, so now it's his turn to help Mr. leonard."

21200,8,0,0,"He starts to want to work out with the team after finding out, it has a great impact on his decision to continue with runing."
21201,8,2,2,"Paul is confused and somewhat angry. 'why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul was astonished at the fact that Mr. Leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment. Mr. Leonard replied with comments such as 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul felt as if he had some of Mr. Leonard's qualities in him, and since Mr. Leonard help him he should return the favor. 'It's time too start you training.'"
21202,8,0,0,Mr. Leanard was a hall monator in middle school. he was select few in a leraning program. He also worked with a tutor. He wroked with Mr. leonard with track.
21203,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard was a poor reader and the effect that background information has on Paul the emotions in Mr. Leonard words were all to familiar they knew them well.
21204,8,0,0,I think the effect on Paul is huge. Considering that somebody of that skill is taking their time to help him overcome 'obstacles' in his life. The story shows this when Mr. Leonard asks what Paul is doing after school and then taking time to bring him to the track and train with him.
21205,8,2,2,Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read just like himself. And also that Mr. Leonard was a track star. It made Paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend.

Mr. Leonard inspired Paul because they are very similar, Paul was bad at school also and Paul is also a great athlete. It gave Paul so inspiration in life to succeed."
21209,8,2,2,Paul is shocked when he finds out who Mr. Leonard realy is.  Then when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard cant read either he has remorse for him.  Paul new his pain all to well and thats why he decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.

21215,8,1,1,Paul feels that Mr. Leonard and him have so much in common. Paul has trouble reading and the reason Mr. Leonard didn't know his name was because he was a poor reader as well. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard it made him feel comfortable knowing that he wasn't alone in his situation and someone just as great as Mr. Leonard struggled as well.
21216,8,1,0,Because pauls coach child life is simmilar to his as in a good runner but a bad reader....
21217,8,2,2,"Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard's track talents. He feels very empathetic for Mr. Leonard when he learns he can't read because Paul has the same problem. Paul has even felt the same feelings of embarrassment when asked to read aloud, for this reason he feels for Mr. Leonard."

When Paul saw Mr. Leonard the next day Paul asked him about the printout that Paul had printed out the night before then Mr. Leonard explain the first parts of his track career. The Paul asked him what else happened and Mr. Leonard explain that he copied off his friends in highschool and didn't do hardly any of the work but once he got the collage he didn't know what to do so therefore he lost his scholarship and flunked out of collage.

This effected Paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor. He was so successful. Mr. Leonard explained to him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This impacted Paul into teaching Mr. Leonard about high school and decided to step up. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'"
21303,8,1,1,Paul is suprised at what he finds because Lenard didnt  tell hima nyhting about his past and Paul found out for him-self.

This is so by Mr. Leonard also not being able to read like Paul, although they didn't have service learning centers back then. Therefore, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard begin to start reading."
21328,8,2,2,"During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well. He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard. After all, Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles. Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read."
21329,8,2,2,"One effect that learning about Mr. Leonards track history had was giving Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard to read. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard.     Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track. Since Mr. Leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete, Paul might want too prove himself to Mr. Leonard and himself that he can succeed. Also, if Paul succeeds, Mr. Leonard does too, since he taught Paul everything."
21330,8,0,0,MR.Leonard is a classic exsampel of a person who is focast on his sport and not on his grades only to find out later in life that he needed the grades more than the sport.
21331,8,0,0,"You can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on, like the hurdle the first time Paul did them."
21332,8,2,2,Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21333,8,2,2,Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
21334,8,1,1,"I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in."
21335,8,0,0,He went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but Mr. Leonard didn't graduate because he couldn't read.
21336,8,1,1,"Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess."
21337,8,2,2,The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it. Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard couldn't read. That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read.
21338,8,2,2,Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
21339,8,2,2,When Paul found out that Mr. leonard did hurdles in collage  (38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals) he was very enthused.
21340,8,0,0,"The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was."
21341,8,0,0,He probably didn't know that Mr. Leonard ran track and broke many records. He had to keep that a secret from Paul. So his hopes wouldn't come crashing down just because he couldn't read. He didn't want that to happen to Paul.
21342,8,0,1,he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionHe relizes all of this when Mr. Leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
21343,8,1,1,"That Mr.Leonard is a good and talented athlete, but a very poor reader. Paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read. Finding out about Mr. Leonard pushes Paul to read and work hard."
21344,8,1,1,It effects Paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in School. He knows this now because Mr. Leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships.
21345,8,2,2,"When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage."
21346,8,2,1,"The background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard, helps motivate him.  It might make Paul, really work on his reading.  Even though Paul is still young, his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like Mr. Leonard, and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either.  You can tell by that, from when he tells Mr. Leonard, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time you start your training.'"
21347,8,1,1,"When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses."
21348,8,0,0,"pau  is a trsck player in high school still, he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments, also he's a very fast runner to"
21349,8,2,2,I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21350,8,1,1,It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
21351,8,0,0,he takes paul to different places to see what hes interested in and he found it by going out on the track.
21352,8,2,2,"The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did."
21353,8,1,2,"The background information had a great effect on Paul. It did because Paul had not realized who Mr. Leonard was and wanted to know more. When Mr. Leonard told him about his college struggles and his ability to not read well, Paul felt like he could help. In the end Mr. Leonard helped motivate Paul to try hurdling. Just like Paul helped motivate Mr. Leonard to learn to read for the first time. This effected Paul by helping him gain a new friend and trainer."
21354,8,1,1,Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him. It even encouraged Paul to obey Mr. Leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field.
21355,8,2,2,When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past he is encouraged because Mr. Leonard could not read but still broke records in track. Paul also want to return the kindness Mr. Leonard has shown him so Paul is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21356,8,0,1,The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes Paul more sensitive to why Mr. Leonard has been pushing and training him.
21357,8,0,0,It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.
21358,8,2,2,"Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul. When they are at the track and Mr. Leonard asks for Pauls name, is a good sign that Mr. Leonard cannot read either. Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share. The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him. Paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time. Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul out, but the only way for him to help is if Paul lets him. Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat. But little by little Paul finds out and it motivates Paul to be a better person, athlete and harder worker."
21359,8,1,0,"The background information about Mr. Leonard, helps Paul believe that he can get better in track, knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler."
21360,8,1,1,Paul was disapointed with Mr. Leonard. Paul showed this by saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this?' After Paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him. Paul wants to do better then Mr. Leonard.
21361,8,2,2,"Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor."
21362,8,2,2,"Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him. Also, Paul understands why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because Mr. leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college."
21363,8,2,2,Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
21364,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read."
21365,8,0,0,"When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day."
21366,8,0,0,"The information Paul found could have discourage him, as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by Mr. leonard.  Just by PAul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot."
21367,8,1,1,"Paul was shock to discover that his caoch, was the best runner in college his freshman year. Paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about Mr. Leonard achievement. When paul discovered what happen he was sad.  Now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like Mr. Leonard."
21368,8,0,1,When Paul figures out what happen to Mr. Leonard when he was in high school and college showed him that they were both alike. He believed that Mr. Leonard was trying to show him that anything is possible.
21369,8,2,1,"He highly apriciates what Mr. Leonard has done for him. Now knowing Mr. Leonard has the same problem as he does, he wants to help him out just like Mr. Leonard helped him."
21370,8,2,1,"During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him ."
21371,8,1,2,"The effect that the background information that Paul is provided with is that Paul realizes that if he tries hard he can become successful. When the highschool coach gives Paul the opportunity to get information on Mr. Leonard, he takes it. Paul then confronts Mr. Leonard to ask why he did not go on to do greater things. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul that he had learning issues like him and encourgages Paul to try his best so he does not end up like Mr. Leonard."
21372,8,1,1,He weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help Mr.Leonard.
21373,8,0,0,That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
21374,8,0,0,"The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard has an effect on him. He didn't know, at the beginning, that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.      Mr. Lenonard didn't want to tell Paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him, he wouldn't want to train or try something new. However, if Paul had known, things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training.      The saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover', has meaning here. Mr. Leonard is the book, and just because he's the hall monitor doesn't meant that he didn't have a successful past. Paul getting to know Mr. Leonard was a way for him to become someone."
21375,8,2,2,Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21376,8,0,0,It kind of shows him what kind of person Mr. Leonard was back then.
21377,8,2,2,"Paul is effected by finding out Mr. Leonard's backround as a star in track is, Paul becomes inspired to do well in track, just like Mr Leonard."
21378,8,1,2,The effect the background information has on Paul is to show that they are alike. Paul does not know how to read and struggles in class. By learning Mr. Leonards background information he sees that Mr. Leonard also had a hard time in school and could not read. It also helps him understands that he is not the only one and knows that Mr. Leonard understands how Paul feels.
21379,8,1,1,That he wanted to help Mr. Leonard with his challenge of reading.It said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read.So that  Mr. Lenord can go to college to complete his goal.
21380,8,2,2,"I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past."
21381,8,1,1,He begins to understand why Mr. Leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted Paul to do well in track but also do well in school.
21382,8,1,1,He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
21383,8,1,1,When Paul learns about what Mr. Leonard used to be he is suprised. You know this by how he shows Mr. Leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38. But he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45.
21384,8,1,1,It makes Paul and Mr. Loenard better friends because he was helping him train and he was being very good to him and Paul was being good and progressing very well and when he found out about his trainer he wanted to help him just like his trainer helped him.
21385,8,0,0,Paul was a great athlete but he cound not read. Paul didnt know who Mr. Leonard was and Mr. Leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read. when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport.
21386,8,1,1,paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
21387,8,2,2,"When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him. Once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well, that encourged Paul to work harder at reading and teach Mr.Leonard how to read better just like he taught Paul to be a athlete."
21388,8,1,2,"Once Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, it makes him feel stronger. he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read, he sees that he is not alone. That information pushed Paul to strive for the better, in the hurdles and at reading. He sees that he has more oppurtunities than Mr. Leonard did, and decideds to take advantage of them, for the better."
21389,8,1,1,"Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question."
21390,8,2,2,"The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul."
21391,8,1,1,"The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard makes him want to help Mr. Leonard, because he helped him."
21392,8,2,2,When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
21393,8,0,0,"Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read. So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day."
21394,8,0,0,Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21395,8,1,1,"Paul was working on his hurdling and the high school track coach came up and talked to him. Paul got a URL for the Track and Field website, and the coach said 'do a search for 'Grabowski.' Which Grabowski is the guy that has been training Paul to be good at Hurdles. Once Paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that Grabowski did."
21396,8,2,2,In what Paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a track star in high school and confused that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him. It also probably suprised him that Mr. Leonard didn't become famous because he couldn't read because earlier in the story he was confused because Mr. Leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions.
21397,8,2,2,Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records. Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him. Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student. This relates to Paul because he can't read that well.
21398,8,2,2,Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.
21399,8,0,0,"Mr.Leonard began walking back toward the school,then turned and asked"
21400,8,1,1,I think it motivated Paul to do better in school and do be the best at track that he could be.
21401,8,0,0,"Paul thinks that sense Mr. Leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike Mr. Leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read. Paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read, so Mr. Leonard seen he was trying and it made him proud,just because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life."
21402,8,1,1,ITS SURPRISES HIM A LOT. WHEN HE IS ASKING MR. LEONARD WHY WAS HE HIDING THAT FROM HIM
21403,8,2,2,"Paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but, later he finds out that Mr. Leonard and him are not so different because in Mr. Leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too."
21404,8,0,2,"After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's history, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals. Mr. Leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life. He is concerned for Paul. Paul then understands that he must overcome his weakness in reading because he doesn't want to give up like Mr. Leonard had."
21405,8,0,0,From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
21406,8,2,2,The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding. Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read. And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again. Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life.
21407,8,1,1,The backround information effected Paul because it made him feel like he can come over any obsticle in life. Paul came to conclusions that he can achieve anything if he put effort into it. Once he read on Mr. Leonard background that gave him motivation to accomplish his goals.
21408,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream."
21409,8,1,1,It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard
21410,8,1,1,The background information that Paul recieves helps him to see why Mr. Leonard was helping him and pushing him.
21411,8,1,1,The background information that paul has recieved is shocking.  Paul had no clue that Mr. Leonard was so good at hurdles.  Paul wonders why that he didn't go pro and didn't finish college out.
21412,8,2,2,"The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters."
21413,8,0,0,"He questions him about it, he wants to know why he stoped."
21414,8,2,2,"When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something."
21415,8,2,1,"The background information on Mr. Leonard had a motivating effect on Paul, because Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul, who was also a great runner."
21416,8,0,0,"The effect that the background information has on Paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast, you can always be a success in something."
21417,8,0,0,The information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as Mr. Leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do.
21418,8,1,1,"When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading. He said that Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar to him, so now he will work hard to help himself and Leonard"
21419,8,2,1,He waas really surprized that Mr.Leonard was a collage athlete and he broke records.When Mr.Leonard told Paul that he wasnt a good reader he couldnt under satnd why not untill Mr.Leonard explaned to him the situation that the scoots told him not to worry about the grades just worry about the sport and he failed his classes and Mr.Leonard had to drop out. Mr.Leonard wants to set a goal for Paqul to achevie.
21420,8,2,2,"Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard feels the same way he does about reading.  He wants to help Mr. Leonard to become a better reader, just like Mr. Leonard is helping him with track."
21421,8,2,2,"Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do."
21422,8,2,1,"When Paul learns the backgroiund information of Mr. Leonard, it motivates him to excel both in track and field as well as in school. In addition to motivating Paul, the backgroiund of Mr. Leonard also inspires him to do well in everything he does and gives him the idea to help Mr. Leonard back."
21423,8,1,2,"Before Paul finds the background information over Mr. Leonard, he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor. After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul."
21424,8,1,2,"When he learns the background information, Paul realizes that he understands the feelings that Mr. Leonard's words were having. He understood how he was embarrassed that he couldn't read, and that he went after something he could excel at. That's why Paul said he had something he could do for Mr. Leonard."
21425,8,1,0,"he knew how he felt because he was in the same situation, he helped him get help at the learning center."
21426,8,2,2,paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21427,8,0,0,The background information makes Paul curious at first. It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. It made him question Mr. Leonard about why he didn't share the information. It also makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport. It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
21428,8,0,0,That Mr. Lenoard was a godo athlete but he didnt do good in school so he got fluncked and he wants to help the narator so that he can do good in school and have a succesful careere.

The reader knows that Mr. Leonard is the hall monitor and keeps the kids moving, shows an interest in students who struggle with school, and used to be a track star.         By being a hall monitor, Mr. Leonard is used to telling kids where to go and what to do. The kids in return are used to obeying him. That's why Paul never quit when Mr. Leonard made him do more work because he had been 'conditioned by hearing those words every day.'     Mr. Leonard is empathetic towards Paul because he knows what it feels like to not do well in school. He even admits to Paul the he 'lost my scholarship and flunked out'      All of these examples give background information on Mr. Leonard."

Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend?  Mr. Leonard responce was 'I was a good Athlete, but not a good student.  I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard'.  So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track."
21532,8,2,2,"Whenever Paul looked up all the acheivments that Mr. Leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of, what was, a star athlete. In paragraph 39, Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard's success."

But even thow Mr.leonard didn't now how to read he was able to help him Get threw it now the boy can say that Mr.leonard was very exsired to him so he would never give up.
21538,8,1,1,"I believe that Paul was encouraged to see that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough. Mr. Leonard showed Paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go, and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time, Paul made that push happen."
21539,8,0,0,In paragraph 44 Mr. Leonard said that his college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter. He flunked out of school and no other school wanted a runner that wouldn't read.

Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didn't have a Learning Center back then, that would help him with his grades. So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed. I think Paul also felt, that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties."

21546,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul. This is because what he found was this: Mr Leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles. He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles.     Paul wasn't aware of this and asked why. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he couldn't read and flunked out of college. After that, nobody wanted a runner that could not read. Therefore, Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career.      This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read. It will show him to never give up, and always try your best in life."
21547,8,2,1,"The reader gets background information on Mr. Leonard, and the effect it has on Paul is that he believes he can do it because Mr. Leonard could not read just like him. Paul believes that he can do it because he knows that Mr. Leonard did it in college. Even though Mr. Leonard flunked out in college doesn't make a difference to Paul because Paul believes in himself and believes that he can do this no matter what.

He knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given Paul with the hurdles."
21552,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard have to look at the background of paul. Because they have the same problem . At first Paul didn't want to think about it and tell Mr. Leonard to walk back toward school.

They made him feel very embarrassment about it because they would call on him and he didn't want to answer amd knew everybody else was better.

Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible. But then Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help. Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much.

The reason comes from the article where Paul first meets Mr. Leonard when he is in the hall going to the Learning center and this is when Mr. Leonard compared himself to Paul and saw something in him beginning their relationship. Also getting the background information gave Paul someway to repay Mr. Leonard for what he has done and that is why he said what he said in the last paragraph, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard.

Paul was always chosen last for a basketball team so Mr. Leonard to Paul to the track to train him for hurdlers. I believe Mr. Leonard saw himself as Paul.

21717,8,2,2,"Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in his running days. Mr. Leonard tells him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good enough student. We had no learning centers in our school.'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading. He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading."
21718,8,1,2,The information about Mr. Leonard that Paul finds is probably effected him in a way that he didn't understand why Mr. Leonard wouldn't tell him that he used to be an amazing at hurdleing.

Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading."

21723,8,0,2,"The effect that the background information has on Paul is it pushes him to stride forword and do better, it also helps him realize that even thou you can't read you can still accomplish great things. With Mr. Leonard, that great thing was breaking the 400 meter hurdles records at nationals."
21724,8,2,2,"The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story. By learning that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, we know that he and Paul have the same problem.

21725,8,2,2,"When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background, that he flunked out of college, Paul was very understanding.  Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was; Paul couldn't read.  Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul.  For example, in paragraph 45, the narator, Paul, says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'

He also sees that education is just as important as sports and working hard will get you places just like Mr. Leonard worked hard at sports. It also gave Paul motivation to be as successful as Mr. Leonard but this time he could pass college while learning how to read."
21727,8,1,1,"Paul ggets excited to hear about his past, but then begins to feel sad for Mr. Leonard as he soon finds out about what happened to him in college. By understanding that he needs to work harder than what he is doing right now to be outstanding."

Paul has an advantage: the remedial reading program. Paul goes twice a week and continues to learn to read. Mr. Leonard did not have this luxury and, in time, flunked out of college. Mr. Leonard sees himself in Paul and strives to make Paul an exceptional hurdler. When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's past, he feels a connection between them. Paul realized this man had given time to help him and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard as well.

23037,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by putting specific ideas together.  The author opens the article with an intense introduction, but then settles down into a serious tone.  The author procedes with one idea at a time describing was space debris is.  The author ends the article with a reality reminder that space agencies need to work together and solve this problem."
23038,9,2,2,"At first the author draws you in with the cliche Superman knock-off line, but then gets more serious through out the entire article. He does an introduction, a brief history of space exploration and what Space Junk is, tells how dead or disabled satellites can crash into each other, and then ends with hope saying coporations are trying to come up with a viable solution to space pollution."
23039,9,2,1,"He starts off by telling about clusterd space is. Then he goes on to talk about how this can be a threat to earth. For instance, when two dead satellites collide it doesn't just make two things of debris in space it makes many microdebris that can hit the earth, plane, or even a spacecraft."
23040,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by breaking it down into sections and talking about different things in those sections, like What is Space Junk? and Crash Course."

23042,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by first starting with an introduction that catches the readers' eye. The introduction also contains the thesis statement 'Orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satalite missions.' Next, the author describes what space junk is, and how it was created. After that, in the section titled 'Crash Course', the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted. Finally, in the last section, the author talks about possible solutions and the persisting problem of space junk."
23043,9,2,1,The article is organized by first telling about space exploration and then it moves on to telling about space crashes that have actually happened. After that it goes on to talk about how serious the debris is.
23044,9,2,2,"The author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections. The first section explains the main purpose of the aticle. The second section explains how all of this space 'junk' has gotten there. The third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space. The final section explains the dangers of the space debris and how the space agencies are trying to solve the probelm, and prevent damage from space debris."
23045,9,1,1,First they used a catchy begining to start then they went into a little history and info on the topic in the 'What Is Space Junk' section. From there they told of some of the bad that has happend like to satellites crashinginto one another. Then that opened up the topic of all the fragments that came from those two sattilites flying around in space.
23046,9,1,1,They did a great job oganising this article: first they get your attintion with grab you telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! Its a meteor!. Then they get right in to the article about the What is Space junk.
23047,9,1,1,"The author starts with an exciting introduction to lure the reader in. Next, the author starts explaining the problems and why we should be concerned. Then, the author persuades us to feel motivated."
23048,9,0,0,The author puts the selection in a story format to make it seem much more interesting and to make the story have alittle more detail. When he did that he could grab the readers attention.

The author grabs your attention by giving what was said in his/hers class room, then they go on to tell you important information, for example of an important thing the author said is 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite'. These things they've mentioned are important already."
23050,9,1,1,He puts it into different sections that talk about different things and talks about facts in each section.
23051,9,2,2,"He starts out by telling the concern of space junk, then moving on to what space junk is and what it's about.

I understand the need to be concerned about this space junk, because it could cause a lot of problems with the Earth, astronauts, and space crafts."
23052,9,1,2,"The passage is sorted into four different sections. Each of the sections emphasize different, but equally important topics. Its begins with an attention grabber, and the the body is sorted into three paragraphs each one being supported with a lot of evidence. They conclude the paper strongly emphasizing the importance of 'space junk.'"
23053,9,2,2,"He first starts out with the introduction to be interesting, to get your attention. Then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this 'space junk' can be.

23054,9,1,1,The narrator organizes ot by breaking the story off in chapters or Seccsions.
23055,9,1,1,"The author organizes the topics by subheads. The subheads break what seems to be long amounts of text into smaller,more  manageable and  appealing. Reading in smaller sections fools the reader into thinking they are not reading as much as they think. Readers' eyes are drawn to the bold text above each topic. This form of organization is a useful tool for organizing large amounts of information."

23057,9,2,2,"The author organizes in a good way, by using sections. the sections help us understand more about the space junk in space. One section tells about the space junk and what it exactly is. Another tells us about some satellites craching into others and making more space junk. Each section tells us more and more about this arising problem in space."
23058,9,1,1,Starts out about outter space then gets into the junk up there and the technology.
23059,9,1,1,The author sporates it in to many parts and that makes it very organized. It being in the parts that it is makes it easy to find stuff if a certain part is asked about. Not having to read the hole article is nice if you can just read the headings and know where stuff is what's the point of wasting a lot of time reading the whole thing when you just neeed to read the middle section.
23060,9,2,2,The author begins the article by relating to the reader in a humorous way. Once the reader has been hooked in the author begins to describe how big of a problem space junk really is. After describing what space junk is the author talks about the dangers of the space junk and how big of a problem its becoming. Then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger. The auhor talks about how space travel is actually the cause and we need to put forth an effort to clean space pollution rather than adding to an already dangerous problem.
23061,9,2,2,The Space Junk title is starting of by saying there is actually Space Junk. In the next paragraph they are saying how the Space Junk even gets there. In the last one they are saying how the Space Junk can harm Space Shuttles and all different kinds of things.

They explained what Space Junk was and how it was harmful. Then moved on to how they detect the Space Junk and how little bits of it is a serious problem.
23065,9,2,2,"He splits the article up into five sections: introduction, what is space junk?, crash course, little bits but a big deal and a conclusion.     In his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines 1and 2. In sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one. He does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk. Then, in the conclusion he wraps it up by saying he is sure this problem will continue especially with an increace in commercial space travel."

23070,9,2,2,"The author starts by getting the reader 'excited'. Then they get let down because the 'comet' isn't a comet, it's a tool bag. The line 'It's a . . . tool bag?' directs that.      It starts talking about how several civilizations began to send satellites and spacecraft into space and how they eventually 'die'.So the author explains what happens and what can happen to different things that happen to be left in the 'Final Frontier'."
23071,9,0,0,i think that the article is not very organized.

23074,9,2,2,"First he starts out by getting the readers attention by personal experiance. after the readers attention is caught, he explains the reasoning for his introduction. He then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head.

Then, goes into more serious matter dating back to when satelites were first built. After the author explains that the satelites can crash and once they do that and 'die', they are automatically assumed as space junk. Then the author explains that even though the satelites and their peices can be little, once more and more start 'dying', then outer space can become clutered quickly."

23102,9,1,1,"The author of 'Orbiting Junk' grabs your attention but shouting out statements, it makes you wonder what the author is talking about.

He talks about global wirelees stuff and how the things he does works for him. and how he loves what he does. when talking about the aritcle the guy talks about how people rsearch stuff and read about stuff and get the wrong idea about how science is prtraid.  it think it has a lot to do with the guys opinon about how people look at the science portion of this article.       for the guy who was writing this article he has a huge disatvantage when it comes to explaining things in this aritcle, when people don't understand the things your talking about it makes everything that much harder to talk about.      if you have peoples attention make sure they know what your talking about or atleast know the subject of the things your talking about."

23119,9,2,2,"First, the author grabs the readers attention by making an awkward yet interesting opening statement, which is 'It's a . . . tool bag?' The next passage after that becomes a little more serious to make the reader understand how harmful space junk can be.      Then in the next section, the author gives the reader background information on space junk. That is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk. That section connects well the Crash Couse section, which tells the reader some specific information about crashes in space.     The final section explains in an elaborate way how harmful space junk can be and what cause it can have in the future.

23253,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article really well in my opinion. The author starts off with an interesting introduction that slowly brings you into the rest of the article.     After that they get into a sub topic clearloy explaining exactly what is space junk and how it has developed in our orbits. They used many facts that really impact the readers knowledge about this space junk.     Next they talk about how the debris free-orbiting the eart can cause collisions with other debris. They use facts and even an instance where the colliosions have appeared.     In the final topic they speak about the dangerous and the threats that the debris can cause. This passage is very well made with facts, comparisons and even an instance of adding more dangerous space junk by loosing a tool bag."
23254,9,2,1,"The author starts by telling a simple story about a tool bad falling from the sky. Then the author defines space junk and it's threat to Earth. The it gives some information about two satellites crashing. Last but not least, the author tells us the big pictures. Such as how the debris can harm spacecrafts and imcreasing amount of space junk."
23255,9,2,2,The author starts off by explaining the situation and what has been going on in space which would be the section titled 'What Is Space Junk.'  After he explains the situation he moves on to describe how this is a bad thing and how it is happening.  Then he ends it by talking about how it can affect us.
23256,9,2,2,"I think the author did a fine job with organizing this article. By getting the reader's attention in the introduction with dialouge, I became interested about what this article would help me learn about. After the introduction, the author spent his or her time informing the reader about what 'space junk' really is. Next, the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother. Finally, the last paragraphs were to show the reader how important 'space junk' is and how much NASA and other space exploring organizations are concerned with it."
23257,9,0,0,The author organizes the article by fact and opinion.
23258,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration. The author puts 'What is Space Junk?' first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere. The puts 'Crash Course' this is letting us know that the space junk is now orbitting around the earth at intense speeds. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the Earth."
23259,9,2,1,"The author organizes the article well with the start of a simple introduction. The author then starts with individual topics to explian the cause. The author begins with explaining space junk, then how it effects the crash course. Then lastly, the author explains how little bits can become a big deal."
23260,9,1,1,The author organizes the article with different topics realting to 'space junk.' The author uses seperation by organizing the article with different sub-topics that explain in more detail the dangers in space junk.
23261,9,2,2,The author organized the article in a unique way. Firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment. then explaining what he was going to talk about 'space junk'. Then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes. After that how little bits can make a big deal later on. Finally ending with a conclusion.
23262,9,2,2,"In the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space. In the second section the author tells about how free-orbiting satellites can crash into each other, causing small satellites to be formed. In the last section of paragraphs the author talks about how big of a danger small free-orbiting satellites can pose and how many countries are trying to find a soloution to the problem."
23263,9,1,1,"The author organizes this article in a way that first presents the problem, then the author goes into further depth about the issue. The author first explains where space debris comes from then explains why it is so dangerous. The author begins with a fact, 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.' This makes the reader understand first where the space debris comes from, then the author discusses the dangerous effects of space debris.'At extreme speeds, little bits can pack a punch powerful enough to create disastrous holes in an object moving through space.'"
23264,9,0,0,I think the aurthor organizes the article by putting the actions first and i thaink thats what makes the aruthor have veiwers and grabes the atention !! (: Also i think another way was the aurthor put interesting facts in the story that would also atract people to read the aurthor's story !! (:

Line 4: 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched th efirst artificial satellite. The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.' The third section is what's going on now with the topic. Line 6: 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run th erisk o fcollding with each other. That's exactly what happened in February 2009.' The last section is why the reader should care about the topic. Line 8: 'So who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash?'"
23268,9,0,0,the auther wanted to write aboutthe danger of debris in space that culd destroy the satilites if not checked.
23269,9,0,0,Who organizes it over what things are important in space junk and the exploration of space junk.
23270,9,1,1,The author organized the article by splitting sections of paragraphs up using different chapter titles. This way the article can change topics somewhat freely without looking unprofessional. It also helps the author in knowing what to talk about where.
23271,9,1,2,"This article is organized by facts. Some are about junk,spacecrafts themselves,and even space trash. It is very well organized by the paragraphs."
23272,9,2,1,"The author organizes his thoughts very uniquely in this article.  For instance, they start out with a shocking statement for a lure.  Then they move on to a definition, and such requires the history of the objects.  After such they follow suite with the dangers of microdebris out in space and just how lethal it can become.  Upon the end of that they switch to how to counter-act the problem."
23273,9,1,1,He organizes it in different sections to seperate the different topics. He does this so that the reader doesn't get confused and it makes it more appealing to the reader.
23274,9,1,1,"He puts the stuff into a way like a person writing a paper. He puts the indtroduction, then a couple of paragrahs explaining what it is, then he gives a conclusion."

23276,9,1,1,"He organizes in diffrent sections, describing each section."
23277,9,1,1,They first give a brief history of the world's space exploration. In the same paragraph the author tells the reader about what space junk is and how it comes about. The author then expands on different subjects under 'Space Junk' throughout the article.
23278,9,2,2,"The author organizes it by first explaining what space trash and debris actually is. He does this with the heading What is Space Junk? Under this heading he talks about how space junk actually occurs, as well as a little bit of the history of space travel. Then he uses the heading Crash Course to talk about the different crashes between free-orbting satelites in the past. Then finally he uses the heading Little Bits, But a Big Deal to try to make the readers understand that even those small tiny bits of trash can seriously harm the functioning satelites and other space craft."
23279,9,2,2,The author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line. From the intro the author contunues onto define what space junk is to inform the reader what the rest of the paper is about. After defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made. After making sure the reader know what she is talking about the author goes into the subject of how dangorus these pieces of junk are to astronuts and space travelers. In the same paragraph the author also states the the scientifical community is serching for a solution to clean up the debries.
23280,9,1,2,"The author at the beginning, grabs your attention by saying shocking facts. Next, the author jumps right into factual information, such as: space junk. Then, the author discusses the harmful use of the present time. Lastly, the author talks about the future harms to come to space by talking about countries launching satelites into space, which will cause an extreme load of space junk."
23281,9,1,1,The author organizes the article into sections with headings. The headings give you an idea about what you will learn in the passage below the heading.
23282,9,1,1,The author divides it up into a few sections. Which I think is a pretty good idea because it grabbed my attention.
23283,9,0,1,"It gives specific detail about the space, and it tells you that scientist are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk. It's giving information about the satelite problems."
23284,9,0,0,"They organized the articles by telling what the problem was, then go over if these things stay in space how they could harm us."
23285,9,2,2,"By how things happen and when they happen. this is how he does it. What is Space Junk?Crash CourseLittle Bits, But a Big DealHe does it that way so you know what the passage is going to be about and what it is going to talk about.  He also does it so you know the title of the passage and so you don't have to try to figure out what it is about . Another reason he does it so he can orginaze the story into different sections."

23287,9,2,1,The author organizes the article first by giving the background information of the start of space exploration. They continue on to define satellites and how they are used. The second section describes how the satellites played a role in history. Then the author goes on in the last section to describe how the satellites are a problem now by explaining how they are involved in space pollution.
23288,9,2,2,"The author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space. The first section just explains that there are things in space called 'space junk'. The second section explains what  space junk is, and how it got there. The third section explains that free-orbiting things move quickly, and there is a possibility that these things can crash into each other. Lastly, the fourth section the author talks about how even such little things such as pieces of debri are a big deal to people, scientists, and the Earth."
23289,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article by first talking about Orbiting Junk, then What is space junk, then Crash Course, then Little Bits, But a Big Deal.  It just talks about each one indavigally by its self."

23291,9,0,0,he organizes it in the years
23292,9,1,2,"The author catchs or attention by making a some what funny statement. Then the author tells us some history behind spae invasion, in this section they talk about what happens to the debris that comes close to the earth. In the next section they talk about crashes that have happened between satellites from different countries They tell us a little story about how an astronaut lost his tool belt in space.

The author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information. In the Crash Course topic, the author states that not just outer space crashes create debris, but random small objects too. In Little Bits, But a Big Deal, the author elaborates on why we should be concerned. One reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them.     The author ends with an outro paragragh stating that the problem is increasing, but there are people looking for a cheap and easy way to solve the space debris problem."
23295,9,0,0,The author organizes this article to get peoples attention. To try and let them know that things are dangrous and we don't see it. I feel all the author was trying to do is get his/or her point across in a way that would let everyone understand.

The next thing that is talked about is examples of how space junk ended up flying through space, like when the astronaut lost his grip on a tool box. The last thing he tells the reader what problems the space junk is causing and how people like NASA are trying to solve the problems."
23297,9,1,2,The author starts off the article with a simple introduction that will grab the reader's attention because of the funny reference. The author slowly goes into the importance of the debris floating around in space. The next paragraph of the article starts to inform the reader just what is space junk to clear up any other myth about it.        The examples of stories and even facts about what exactly is orbiting our earth keeps the article's main purpose flowing. Their idea was to lead into the true facts that the amount of debris orbiting with the earth is a great amount. The last paragraph is meant to leave the reader thinking about what is actually going on in the space above us.
23298,9,1,1,He put new headngs on it.Every time he would stairt a new secshion.
23299,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article into multiple sections which each have their own topic to cover. The topic of space hazards is too general to cover in one section, so many sections are needed to describe all aspects of the idea the writer is hoping to get across."

23333,9,1,1,"The way this statement is organized is very well because they start off by getting your attention. Next they start with some basic information that will help you understand what is coming up, then after they hit the hard facts that you should know about 'space junk' like how even the smallest things in space can affect a big space ship with this happening also that we could have satellites crashing into each other and the tiny parts flying into earth. So this article is very organized."

Finally, in the section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' they emphasize that even though most space junk is only tiny peices, it is a serious problem and can cause a lot of issues."
23348,9,1,1,He organized them according to how serious the issue is. They are all a big p-roblem but some more then others. Like the satellites are all going to crash eventually is a scary thing to think about. Space debris is not always small there are some debris out there that would blow up a bigger satellite. Plus the astronauts have to go up there and fix things that get broke by the debris.
23349,9,1,1,"The author organizes this article by first grabbing the readers attention and then explaining the history of space travel and space junk.  Through the sixth paragraph the author talks about why space junk is dangerous and how it effects us today.  The author also brings up the tool bag inncident.  Most people wouldn't think it was a big deal if a tool bag was let loose in space, but the author organized this article to explain why it is such a big deal after describing what space junk is and to warn everyone of the dangers of space junk."
23350,9,0,0,By telling how space junk is when its in space and factors about it to.

The first paragraph explains to the reader what space junk is, the second paragraph tells how the space junk, explained in the privious paragraph, can be of a affect on sattelites. The third explains how even the littlest bit of space junk can harm satellites or other space objests. If the author would not have explained what space junk was then the reader might be lost in the second and third paragraph, same goes with if he had not explained how alot of the debre got there then the reader might have been lost in the third paragraph. so the way he titled it by explaining what space junk was then explaing how it got so clutter and how it can have an affect was the way the aothur organised this article."

The sections are named as follows: Orbiting Junk, What IS Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Orbiting Junk refers to the items that are orbiting around the Earth; they are left over from satellite crashes or lost by astronauts. What IS Space Junk explains to the readers about what kind of items are left behind in space. The section Crash Course refers to the event of a Russian and American satellite 'running' into one another. Little Bits, But a Big Deal basically tells the audience about why and how having 'space junk' can harm the Earth."

23525,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by giving background knowledge, then conveying the problem, and finally, giving a call to action for a solution to the problem.      In the first piece of the article, 'What Is Space Junk?' the author gives a bit of information on what he/she is about to be talking about.  The author gives the background information that the reader needs, such as 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.' Then in this piece, he/she introduces the problem to readers, revealing that the satellite that malfunctions and cannot be repared, or the satellite that collided with something else 'becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.'      In the second part of the article, 'Crash Course' the author conveys the problem, which is the overall theme of the article.  He/she even gives an example of a time when the problem occured when 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The author reveals that satellites can actually collide with each other, and cause space debris which can be extremely harmful.     Finally, the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem.

After that, they start with statistics that shock the reader.  That really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph.  The last few paragraphs show the impact the space junk causes, the efforts of NASA, and the fact that space junk is increasing.  This gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph."
23527,9,2,2,"The way the article was organized by the authur is that; first about orbiting junk, which is objects in free orbit in space. Then it goes in to what is space junk which decribes what space junk really is. Next to crash course which decribes how the satellites crash noto one another. Then finally to little bits, but a big deal which talks about even tho the parts in fre orbit are small but they cause a big problem if they hit anything."

Then the author moves onto the next section, which has examples of how space junk is actually created. Giving prime examples and actual events can make the problem more believable to the reader. The last session is all about why someone should care that space is being polluted. This article is organized by givimg you a how, a when, and a why."
23532,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections, 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal'.

After this the author describes the history of space travel and the space race as well as describing what happens to technology that is broken and just floating around in space in the section 'What is Space Junk?'.  Then in the section 'Crash Course' the author describes how satellites and debris collide and the effects of the collision.  After this point the author describes the horrible impacts of small microdebris on other space ships and satellites and what engineers and scientists are doing to counteract this in the section 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal.'

They start out by a story, then it goes into what space junk is, it gradually goes into talking about satellites and the dangers of those, then it starts to talk about how dangerous space junk really is and the fact that nothing is really being done about it. In the last paragraph, I like how it ends with this, it starts talking about how little of a thing can be such a big problem. We are starting to adjust to the space junk, instead of the space junk adjusting to us. We are changing for it instead of getting rid of the space junk.      I like how this article is structured. It gives detail and stories. It is informative as well as interesting. There are always problems in the world, but to know that even the smallest thing can hurt our world is good to know, as well as knowing that nothing is truly be done about it."
23538,9,1,2,"The first section is used to get the readers attention.  There are not many facts and it makes the subject seem lighter than it really is. The second section pulls out the facts and starts to get serious about the matter, 'in 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.'.  The third section goes into detail about how some of the 'microdebris' came into our orbit and how easy it is to lose somthing in space.

Then the author tells us about the history of countires sending artificial satellites, starting with telling us about when the first one was launched.     Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide. In the Febuary of 2009, two satelites, one American and one Russian, bith collided with eachother. Both of the satellites where considered disabled, and would've been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces. Now, they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision.     Finally, the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something. In space, even tiny particles will cause some major damage.

They set out certain bullet points that they want to talk about and then once they've mentioned the problem in the headline then they go into more detail about it. They have three different things that they talk about specificaly, one being 'What is Space Junk, the second being 'Crash Course' and the third being 'Litlle Bits, But a Big Deal.' The autor makes this an easy read becasue you don't have to read the whole thing to find what you're loooking for because they broke it up into diferent topics and into different paragrapghs."
23680,9,0,0,The author organize the article because you should grab your telescope and look up the sky to see a planet that the satellite would crash another satellite to cause a space pollution try to protect the outer space.
23681,9,2,2,The author organized the article in a sequence of events ranging from how the satellites got into space to how they crash and then tells the reader of the broken satellites severity to other space crafts in orbit.  The author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next.
23682,9,2,1,The author at first gives you some background information on the space race between Russia and the United States.He then talks about how the satellites that were launched need repaired or sometimes crash into each other which is a cause of the 'space junk.' The author then ends the article by telling us the danger and damage this little fragments can cause.

23695,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by different concerns. For example, the first section, 'What Is Space Junk?' describes what 'space junk' is and how it negatively affects the environment. The second section, 'Crash Course', describes how the colliding of satellites affects the amount of microsatellites 'flying through space', which proposes a huge problem for astronauts trying to maneuver around them. The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', describes that while the space debris may be very small they can pose a lot of damage on other spacecrafts, which could ultimately jeopardize the safety of astronauts."
23696,9,0,0,He organizes it by first trying to get peoples attention with the type of sentences he uses in the begining. Then gets serious by trying to convince how important this actuall;y is to him and the enviornment. Then continues that same importance through-out the article.

It's a tool bag?'     Then goes into the begining about how the 'Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.  The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.'  It goes on about what happens when tools float off into space by itself, and how it could be really dangerous.

Then after a catchy introduction, the author talks about what space junk is and how it is harmful to our satellites and how the debris affects Earth."
23794,9,1,2,"It started off with one thing then went to the next. It told us how bad space junk was. This was when the Soviet first put a satellite in space. The crash course told about the satellite. The satellite ran the risk of colliding into each other. The little bits, but a big deal told us what was important and what was not. It showed us the serious problem. Told us about the tiny fragments traveling thre space."
23795,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by putting it in headings.  He has headings such as What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal."
23796,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article into three sections, following the introduction. These are titled 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. These sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read."
23797,9,1,1,He has a new tittle for everything he is about to talk about.
23798,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article with a hook that interest the reader with bold statements, states the main point with background information on satellites history and strong conclusion warning the reader about the dangers of the 'increasing' amount of space junk and suggests a solution to the problem."
23799,9,2,2,"Well, first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting. Immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what 'space junk' is. He then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk. Lastly, he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that NASA is looking for a solution."
23800,9,0,0,The auther tells us how important the space stuff is used.
23801,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article in a text book form.  With sections having titles, What is sapce junk, and then having information under the section titles. It has facts backing up they're statements."
23802,9,2,2,"The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue."
23803,9,1,2,"First, the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations. Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space."
23804,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention. By then identifying the flying object in the sky as 'a...tool bag,' it makes the reader want to read the article. The author goes on by explaining what the meaning of 'space junk' is and how it gets there followed by what happen to satellites when they 'die.' The author finishes his/her article by notifying the reader that space junk is a big deal and is 'increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations  have undertaken  space exploration.'"
23805,9,1,1,The author organizes the article by using bold headings to catch readers attention.
23806,9,1,1,The author first catches your attention with the introduction. The author then explains how space junk is formed and next why it poses a problem in space. The last passage explains the seriousness of the space junk in order to drive the point home.
23807,9,1,2,"The author organizes this article by importance. First he grabs the attention of the reader and then leads into background detail about space junk. The author then provides a paragraph that explains the dangers of satellites. Lastly, the author ties it all up and explains that there are many people who care about a serious problem."
23808,9,1,0,There are many bold faces titles in the artical to show which each one is about.
23809,9,1,1,He put it in year order. he put a title above each section.
23810,9,2,1,"After the introduction, the author starts by describing what this 'Space Junk' is by talking from when the first satellite was launched to the supposedly hundreds of little junk satellites scattered around orbit. 'Crash Course' explains a story about a crash in space that left debris in space and that these accidents can happen at any time in space. The last part talks about how this debris is dangerous despite its size."
23811,9,2,2,"The Author oraganizes this artices very well. He starts out by telling us what space junk really is and how it works.Next, He would tell us about microsatellites and how they are used. At last, he talked about tiny bits of space trash. So over all he did really well oragnizing this article."
23812,9,0,0,"The article is organized in a flowing manner. It starts by giving a point, goes through the body by describing what the narrator means by it, and ends in a call to action."
23813,9,1,1,The author organizes the article by first stateing what space junk is then gentally flows in to how it is a potentailly dangerous hazard for other space explorations and how this matter needs to be taken seriously.
23814,9,0,0,"When people think of space they don't think about all the junk that is in it. when we look up into space we dont see all the junk that is in it either, but what we don't see is a problem. When they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people don't believe it and all the stuff falls down to Earth, nut most of it don't. I think it's sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched."
23815,9,0,0,They tell us that we should look though a telescope and look thought it. There is 33442 satellite the size of a baseball anything goes smaller. This makes it difficult for spacecraft to steer clear of microdebris fields.
23816,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be. For example, it starts off in the first part stating, 'Over the past 52 years... Earth's atmosphere.' This shows the variety and past of spacecraft. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This part leads into the present. Then, finally it shows that how serious space debris is by statating, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' The way the article is wrote is to show the effects of space activity."
23817,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article very well. The author starts with getting your attention he then gives background information on space. Next, the author tells how the debris in space becomes uncontrolled. Finally, the author says how small the debris can be and that this is a big problem."
23818,9,2,2,"The author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention. Then, the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space. After that, the author describes how satellites 'die' and crash into each other, creating microdebris. Next, the author goes to explain the how little pieces of debris, known as microdebris, can be just as harmful as big pieces of debris. And finally, the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space."
23819,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article first with a light, engaging introduction followed by background information, further explanation of risk, and conclusive descriptions of the problems and what is being done about them."
23820,9,0,1,"The author organizes the article in chronological order, starting with the introduction and background information, followed by the current problem, and then how the problem will most likely persist in the future."
23821,9,1,1,The author organizes the articals by headings.
23822,9,1,1,The author uses subtitles to make to article different from others.
23823,9,1,1,He begins by telling us what 'Space Junk' is and then tells us why it is harmful and what harm it can cause. In the end he tells us how scientist are working on a way to fix the 'Space Junk' problem.
23824,9,2,1,"At first the author gives a great explanation on what he or she is going to talk about. He or she starts to explain that space junk is bad for the globe. Then the author starts to explain what the space junk is. It is the human race's great space invasion of the Soviet Union and the United States satellites that have been launched in space. The next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites. If the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore. The next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash, or also called space junk, that is in space floating around."
23825,9,0,0,He organizes it by what is more important to them and they go from there.
23826,9,0,1,"The author starts with 'What is space junk', which tells of space missions and how we 'invaded' space. Then it tells of satellites and how they can crash, then of microdebris."
23827,9,0,0,He puts it together by telling one problem after another.
23828,9,1,1,He puts it into interesting paragraphs and also puts it into interesting caterogies.
23829,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way. The author has chosen to set it up by and seperate the paragraphs by sections, not just spacing and indenting. The author started with background information, then transitioned into information about how free floating satellites, and then concluded with statistics and information from NASA and other space agencies about how space exploration should be done in a more organized and clean way."
23830,9,1,1,The authoe organizes this article in a series so titled paragraphs. The fact that each section of paragraphs tells you what thoes will be talking about. It gives you a little clue as to what you will be reading.
23831,9,1,1,"He puts the article into sections, he is not just jumping around form subject to subject, he gives a title and the article or the section follows it below the title."
23832,9,2,2,The author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a...tool bag?' Then the author told the reader about space junk and the risk it causes like dead satellites at the risk of colliding with each other.  Then the author lets the reader know that space junk is a big deal and people do care about it.
23833,9,1,0,In different paragraphs about different things.
23834,9,1,1,The author put the article under three main topics after the introduction. Under each topic he describes that topic with a lot of useful information.
23835,9,1,1,The author splits the article into groups of two to four paragraphs. The author wants to make it easier to write the article and to help the audience find specific topics in the article. There is a lot of information in this article that could easily make the author lost when he or she is writing and it can make the audience lost easily as well when they are reading the article. The author also makes the organization of the article even easier when he makes the titles of the section in big and bold letters so the sections that somebody may be looking for may be easily found. I think that the article would be confusing as a reader if there were no divisions and sections in this article.
23836,9,0,0,"He organizes it so you better understand the issue.  If space junk and little bits, no big deal were switched you would have no idea what was being said."
23837,9,2,1,"The author organizes the article by putting titles or what is going to be talked about above the paragraph. One example is, 'Little Bits, But a Bid Deal.' The author talks about how much people really care about the lost tool bags or the tiny bits of space trash."
23838,9,0,0,By good details.
23839,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by using a catchy way to bring in the attention of the reader. Lines 1-4 illistrate this. Then the author begins to use facts and statistics to show how serious this topic was. This was the authors main goal it seemed, to show the reader 'space junk' is a serious matter."
23840,9,2,2,The author organizes this article he starts with the intoduction telling what it is about and then he gives a background on space junk and early space explorations. The writer then proceeds to tell about how space juk becomes space junk and then goes on to tell why it is harmful and dangerous and why we should worry about it.
23841,9,1,1,The author organizes the article by using subheadings to seperate the different main ideas that he has. In each of the subheadings the author gives a different idea and gives additional information that will give support to the idea. It gives the reader different categories that related information will fall under.
23842,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by informing us of the dangers of space junk.  The author gives us details the hazards.  They briefly inform us of the history and provide us with a real-life example.  The author states, 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' (paragraph 11).  This proves how dangerous space junk is."
23843,9,0,1,"He organizes it by what happened to the satellite during the colision, what was going on before it happened, and what will happen now after the colision."
23844,9,1,1,The author breaks down the information in to multiple sections. It says what each section is about and sets the tone.

23847,9,0,0,They state alot of facts.
23848,9,2,2,The author organize the article by using headings that tell what the section will be about. Like the heading 'Crash Course' that tells you that this section will be about something that is crashing into something.
23849,9,1,1,"The auhtor organizes this article in chronilogical order. First comes discovery of such junk in space. Then comes the explaination of why stuff is in space. After that, comes the resaon why such junk is created. Then, The article explains how a little piece of junkcan do alot of damage. Last but not least, they give information on what NASA and the European Space Agency plans to do with the junk in space."
23850,9,0,0,he organizes it by starting out with action statments to get the readers attention. then he goes in and explaing what soace junk is.as well with a few good stories.
23851,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article into three different sections. The first one is to explain what space junk really is, because some readers might not understand the concept of it. 'Crash Course,' shows why space junk is important. The author used many details like the collision between a Russian and an American satellite in February 2009, to show that this is a serious problem.The next section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in Earth's orbit is a serious issue. Space junk should not be considered a minor matter."

23855,9,1,1,The author organizes the article with tittles for sections and details all organised together.
23856,9,2,2,"The authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled, pertinant sections. Each section relates to the main idea, which is that there is waste orbiting in space. The section labeled 'What Is Space Junk?' describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from. 'Crash Course' describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut. The final section talks about the size of the objects orbiting earth does not matter because the speed is what causes the most damage."
23857,9,2,1,"The authorstarts off the article by saying what space junk is. Then he goes into how it all began and how some satillites will collide into each other some time, causing big collisions. At the end the author supports how this is a big deal and that we need to start preventing these dangers."
23858,9,0,0,The author organizes this article by usingbuilding the argument layout.
23859,9,1,2,He puts a title over every paragraph he puts something else. Like in Space Junk he talks about how space junk got up there.
23860,9,1,1,"The author starts with an easy-going introduction that gets the readers attention. The author then goes on to tell the reader what kinds of space junk there is; what is really orbiting in space. Next, the author explains to the reader how the satellites crash and debris is formed. The author concludes with telling us that although people care about space debris and it causes many problems, the problem is only getting worse. The way that the author organizes the article is that he or she starts with minimal importance to their words. As the article goes on, the words become more important."
23861,9,1,1,The author organizes it by naming each of the articles a different name. It makes it more easlier to find the certain article.
23862,9,0,0,He starts out informational then gets more deep into his true topic of conversation about the space junk.

23864,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by making the first body parragraph 'What Is Space Junk?' in that paragraph he explains the meaning of space junk. In the Second body paragraph he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space junk. In the last paragrapgh he titled it 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' meaning that even the little pieces of space junk can be a big deal. The pieces are so little but yet so powerful."
23865,9,0,0,He gradually gets more in depth of what space junk can do no matter what the size.
23866,9,1,1,"First it explains about the topic 'Space Junk,' then provides evidence that convinces the reader that its dangerous, and then explains the importance of it."
23867,9,0,0,Scientists are hard-pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk.Both the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and the European Space Agency.
23868,9,1,1,The author organizes the article by using different titles.  By doing this he made it easier for the reader to understand.
23869,9,1,2,"The autor starts out with an attetion getter to make the reader want to read it. Then he goes into a sort of chronological order. He starts with what space junk is, 'What Is Space Junk,' how it is made, 'Crash Course,' and then why is can be dangerous, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' No one would know what space junk is if the author just started with why it was dangerous."
23870,9,1,2,"The author organizes this article by, he tells details about everything. He talks about how the space junk is hurting Earth.     He talks about the past, and life experiences.     How this all started out by that austronaunt that lost a tool bag in space when fixing something, and how it damaged the Earth. How little tiny things can damage the Earth.     How those two satellites had a collusion, and 491 miles per hour. Causing everything to get destroyed."
23871,9,2,2,He explains every topic in a different section. He begins with Space Junk which tells about junk and satellites. He then explains other topic like Crash Course and other little things that fly in the air.
23872,9,1,0,the author tells about space junk floating around are satellites. the author is mostly concerned about the satellites.
23873,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by putting things in order by the title.  At first the tells us what the orbiting junk is, then explains a little about how it can cause a crash, and then how we need to get these out of space. The is how the author organizes this article."
23874,9,0,1,"The author starts off the paragraph that is designed to catch the readers attention from the beginning and keep them interested. The supporting paragraphs to the article help explain the harmful effects of space debris and the purpose to the whole article, and the conclusion again just simply explains the purpose of the article in a different type of writing."
23875,9,2,2,"How the author organizes the article is he puts different information into a different catergory. For example, the category 'Crash Course' is a section that talks about satellites crashing into one another."
23876,9,1,1,The author uses heading in alazised bold font seperate from the original reading that explain what the following words mean.
23877,9,1,1,"The author definitely gets our attention with the gripping introduction, but after that, he starts telling us the history of space junk. When he is done telling us about the history, he then begins to tell us facts and statistics about the revelations that scientists and astronauts have concluded throughout the years."
23878,9,1,1,He separates them into different sub headings.

23881,9,2,2,The author organizes the article by first using an introduction to get the reader's attention and to introduce the topic that will be discussed. He then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk. The author uses his next few paragraphs to tell about a real life story that occurred due to this topic. This story occurred in Februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris. He does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact. His next paragraph is used to compare space junk to objects in real life which will help the reader understand better. The author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts. The last paragraph is the conclusion which is used to sum up what was said and to state that space agencies hope to come up with a sollution.
23882,9,2,2,"Obviously, it is convenient to read under the four headings presented within this article. He begins with an exciting introduction to his topic before establishing his thesis about the dangers of 'space junk.' He then goes on to describe the history of the world's journey into the galaxy and touch on the unpredicted ramifications of such an adventure. Toward the end, the author focuses on the modern problems created by space exploration and how it is imperative for them to be solved before considering future risks of more exploration."
23883,9,2,1,"he states that at one point the orbital pathway was once clear ,but due to spaced exploration it has become cluttered.Then the author points out who discovered space junk.Finally he concludes his story by telling the real danger and serios problems of space junk effecting our planet,futurespace explorations, and even NASA itself."
23884,9,1,1,He has the intro to the article. Then he talks about what space junk is and how it can be dangerous. Then in the next section it talks about how the satellites can crash into each other. And how a tool bag fell out of an Space Station.      He also talks about how space debris is a bad problem and how we have a lot of it. The space trash is increasing.

23890,9,0,0,"In this story to organize things, they sorted all the stuff out that they needed to put together, so it isn't all in random places and so it all makes sense, and none of it is out of wack."
23891,9,0,0,The author uses forshadowing in the second paragraph of the article to emphisize how a little tool box is actualy a big problem. It is well organized by what happens to objects taken up into space.
23892,9,1,1,"The author organizes it so that they talk about what space junk is first and then what happens if it is left alone. They also tell a brief history of space exploration first and gets into more recent times. At the end, they talk about how space junk is becoming more of a problem."
23893,9,2,2,"He organizes it by first getting the reader's attention by using shocking statements in the introduction. Then the author tells the readers about what spack junk is exactly and how it becomes space junk. Then the author tells about because of so many 'dead' satellites they can crash into each other cause they are freely orbiting the earth. Then he or she states that even though after crashes in space and all the little pieces of the satelillets can still harm the earth, because of how much speed is being increased."
23894,9,0,0,he went by what happend first
23895,9,1,2,"The Author Organizes the Articles by first saying what a space junk is. The united states followed suit and thats when the human race begun. The objects themselves, however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth.The second thing he talks about is cash course where dead stellites run the risk of coliding with eacht other like in february 2009. Not only spectacular crashes that create debris. He continues to the section Little bits ,but a big deal were it gets really serious.when a tiny fragment traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft. The amount of trash increasing has taken over"
23896,9,2,2,"The author makes everything build upon each other. first, the aurthor grabbed the readers attention. second, the author got more serious and showed people actually care about space junk. then, the author ended the article by give statistics and statements that make the reader notice the severity of space junk."
23897,9,2,2,"The author uses an 'attention-getter' at the beggining of the article to draw readers in.  He then changes his tone to that of a more formal one.  Underneath the title 'What Is Space Junk,' he familiarizes you with what exactly space junk is.  Next, he uses 'Crash Course' to desribe the possible dangers of space junk in outter space.  Lastly, he emphasizes the seriousness of the problems space junk can cause."
23898,9,0,0,the author organizes the article where you can easily find the information needed.
23899,9,0,0,I think the story is organized in a informational kind of way. At the begining the author starts off with an insteresting facts and throughout it it just tells about information.

23904,9,1,1,The author organize the article by the main reasons and then the conclusion statements abiut it .I know this because when the first paragraph starts with what is space which kind of briefly talks bout space junk and then it talks about how more microdebris is made.
23905,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article with an introduction into the topic, followed by explaining the subject and the effects it holds.  The author explains the subject through the paragraphs titled 'What Is Space Junk?'  Throughout these paragraphs the author gives examples of what space junk is, as well as an example of what happens if 'space junk' were in the Earth's atmosphere.  The author follows with a description as to what happens after satellites become space junk.  The author makes these description in the paragraphs of 'Crash Course.' Throughout the paragraphs 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' the author then explains the effects the space junk has on the spacecrafts sent into orbit."
23906,9,1,0,Tells us the danger about things floating out into space.
23907,9,0,0,The author organizes this article by putting all different things about space. When the author does that it shows that the author knows what he or she is talking about.
23908,9,1,2,"The article is organized by explaining what the problem is, what causes it, and why it is so important. The first section 'What Is Space Junk?' emphasizes what space junk is. The second section, 'Crash Course', tells the reader about how the space junk is created. It talks about the collsion between two satellites that resulted in space junk.

23916,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups. We start of with the Orbiting Junk subgroup, which is the opening paragraghs. Next, we move on to What Is Space Junk, which explains the history of space exploration. It also talks about the problems with this though, and how when a satellite 'dies' it just keeps going in space. That is how we get Space Junk. Next we have Crash Course, which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites. This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem. Last, they have Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This part is the conclusion, and talks about all the problems space junk can cause. It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag. This is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is. So that is how the author organizes this well written article. It helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read."

This organization technique is common in information essays. First, the problem is introduced, and from there the problem is discussed with background information, statistics, comparisons, analogies, and inferences.

24028,9,1,2,The author does a good job of organizing information in this article. The opening paragraph grabs your attention then we get more of a background on how serious space junk is. The author tells us how it is formed and how dangerous it is. At the end of the article the author tells us that these small pieces of junk pose a big threat.

Not all of the satellites can still work because of all the junk that is foalting around. Most of the satellites have actually had problems and came back to earth.
24057,9,1,1,"This article is separated into sections or chapters, each new chapter has a title. The entire chapter sticks to the point. This article is organized as if it was a book."
24058,9,2,2,"He organizes it by sections, by 3 different parts. One is, 'What is space junk', 'Crash Crouse', And 'Little bits, But a big deal'."
24059,9,1,1,Intro. Beginning. Middle. End. First by using shocking statements to grab your attention. Then once the reader has your attention he/she provides you which researched information and the hard facts. After providing the facts he/she explains the various problems space junk can create. Lastly he/she leaves you with a few things to think about.
24060,9,2,2,"The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way.  First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader. Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings. The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories. The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk.' this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves; What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal."
24061,9,1,1,"The article is organized under different headings and the headings are explained.  Also, the years of different facts go in chronological order."
24062,9,1,1,The author starts out with surprising statements to alarm the reader and to make them attentive. The author also has the titles of each section titled appropriately and accuratly to help us understand the seriousness of trash in space. We take space for granted most of the time and we have no idea of the dangers of the junk up there that can actually do harm to earth itself.
24063,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by starting off with the question' 'What Is Space Junk?' In the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space. Then there is another title, 'Crash Course'. Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other. Then there is another titled' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space."
24064,9,2,2,"The author organized the article, 'Orbiting Junk' by adding different sections of reading.  In saying sections, I am referring to the titles through out the article.  'What Is Space Junk?''Crash Course' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'Those titles are all examples of how the author organized his article."
24065,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article in a simple, yet effective way. They have chosen one main point, which is space junk, and created a few subtopics. By doing this, they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem.     The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk."
24066,9,1,1,"The author writes this article so that the term 'space junk' is explained in the beginning.  The process of the object becoming a space junk is explained in the beginning followed by the dangers that occur because of it.  This article is organized so that the reader is informed about space debris little by little.  After being informed on how the 'dead' object can cause harm, the reader then learns about why space pollution is becoming a major problem.       The way this article is organized helps the readers be informed on space pollution without recieving too many information at once.  The article is divided into sections then paragraphs, allowing the reader to understand more easily the information that is being given to them."
24067,9,2,2,"He organizes the article by titling things in sections like, 'What is Space Junk' and only talks about what is needed in that section and 'Crash Course' is another way the author broke up the article."
24068,9,2,1,He oragnizes the article by catching the reader's attetion before explaining the serious issues of space junk. He then explains what space junk is so we understand what he is talking about later on the article better. After he explains what space junk is he talks about the history of us invading space and how stuff gets left behind. Then he explains how space junk is a serious matter to earth and the people heading to space.
24069,9,2,1,"The author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space. Then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions 'both satellites traveling at more than 20,000 mph, crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth'. Then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world."
24070,9,0,0,He organizes through chronilogical order.
24071,9,1,1,The author organized the article with different headings and sections.
24072,9,1,2,"the author starts out as if it's going to be a good story. Then the author goes into how dangrous the 'orbiting junk' can be. Under ' What is Space Junk' they tell you 'over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecrafts' have been launched into space. In ' Crash Course' the author tells you ' with no controls, dead satellites ru n the riskk of colliding with eachother' Last but not least in ' Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells you that 'scientists are hard-pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk'"
24073,9,2,1,"The auther puts the article together in different sections. First, there is the hook and intro. Then, there is some background info and then the statistics and current matters on this subject."
24074,9,0,0,"He organizes it on how much the reader will learn, and how much the reader will read and comprend. He doesn't want his reader getting bored after the first paragraph."
24075,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article by talking about a certain subject, but then hinting to another subject. This hint gives the reader a sense of knowing what is coming up. For instance, in the introduction she mentions space junk, but then she moves into another paragraph explaining what it is. At the end of that paragraph she mentions it 'circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit'. This led into the 'Crash Course' paragraph and so on."
24076,9,0,0,It is organized by how it happens in chronological order. The satellites would have to crash before they would have junk fall off of them.
24077,9,2,2,"In this selection the author organizes his/her main points into sections that relate and flow from one to the other. For example, he/she use the transition form the main title 'Orbiting Junk,' to 'What is Space Junk.' These sections describe what 'space junk' is. Then he/she transition into the dangfers of 'space junck,' by using titles such as 'Crash Course,' which transitions into 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites. The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next."
24078,9,2,2,"The author begins the article with an attention grabber, in order to make the reader interested in the topic.  Giving the reader a little information regarding space junk, the author clarifies the topic and gives details in the second section, 'What Is Space Junk?'.  Describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk.  The author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris, stating that the objects in space are similar to '...[sand] shot from a sandblaster...'  The author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution; he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem."
24079,9,2,1,They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.
24080,9,1,1,The author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections. The author doesn't fuse his or work together.
24081,9,1,0,The author first draws the readers in by using an attention grabber. Then the author gives the reader some history about space. Then he processes on telling the reader about the harmful risks that are accurring  in space.
24082,9,1,1,First the author started talking about the basic information about the space junk and then he wrote what it is use for and also talked abour all rhe dangerous and safety thins about the space junk.
24083,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better. The article starts out with definition 'What Is Space Junk?', goes to how some space junk is created 'Crash Course', and then goes to why space debris is a big deal in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'."
24084,9,2,1,"The author organizes this article by true facts. He first talks about the history and how satellites first started out in space. Then he goes into if the collide what would happen and how it would be harmful to space. He lets you know how some of the satellites travel, how fast they move per second. He lets you know that when they do collide harmful things can come from it. He organized it so that after you something benefitial he urges that something bad can also come from something good."
24085,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by having headings for different topics.  This makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic.  The author begins the article with a common phrase 'It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's Superman!'  but with a unique spin.  The author then presents a heading 'What Is Space Junk' to show that the fun, friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning.  From there, the author uses a new heading (ie..Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal) to show when he is about to begin a new topic."
24086,9,1,1,He starts out with a more general topic then he gets into more specific topics like space junk then he goes on to say crash course and gives a example how a american space craft and a russian craft carshed. Then the auther talks about the debris in the orbit around the earth.
24087,9,2,2,"The author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk, what is space junk?, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal."
24088,9,1,1,"The author of this article organizes it into four different sections. The author introduces a problem, gives the history of this problem, tells you how it occurs, the finally tells you why it matters."
24089,9,0,0,"The author organizes this article into the past, the current, and our future lives. The author organizes this article in a way that the atomosphere seems crucial to our planet."
24090,9,1,2,The author organizes the artice in a simple way. The author grabs the attention of the reader first. The author does this by a comical statement. Then the author goes into how serious of a problem it is right when he grabbed your attention. He gives you simple facts from history and just flat out tells you things so that you don't have to read between the lines. He tells you the basics and then sums it up by saying how important and dangerous space trash is and leaves you to think with that.
24091,9,1,1,"The author begins by giving backround information explaining how common space junk is formed, then leads into how tiny bits of space junk are formed, and finally how these small debris are a big problem."
24092,9,0,0,"The author organizes the article by putting it in order of what is space junk, to why it effects us. In the article it mostly states all of the problems people have had going into space.Their problem all talk about getting hit or crashing into something floating in space."
24093,9,2,2,"The author started off by telling us what space junk is, then went into the different catergories. 'What is Space Junk', is the title for the first couple of paragraphs."
24094,9,2,2,The interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about. What is Space Junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there. Crash Course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher. And the last paragraph tell how all this is really a big deal and something should be done about it.
24095,9,2,2,"They break it into sections, which allows the reading to get a better understaning. For example, in the introduction 'Grab your telescope!' allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence. In the What Is Space Junk? section 'In 1957, the Soviet Union lunched the first artificial satellite.' This give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on. In Crash Course, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding wih each other.' This shows risks and what could happen. Little Bits, But a Big Deal 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' Shows why we should be worried."
24096,9,0,0,The aticle goes from attention getting to informational. Then it is jus importance of space junk.
24097,9,1,1,"The author orginizes the article by putting things together. For example, 'Crash Course' has information about satellies and other things that crash into other things. They put like information together so its easier to go through and find things."
24098,9,1,1,"It starts with an introduction, then it gives subheadings with facts about the subheading."
24099,9,2,2,"The author organizes the artical into groups. He explans all of the groops: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. e explanse what will happen or what could happen in space if something runs into each other or if an astronaut droped something wile working."
24100,9,2,2,"He organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you. Then he tells you what space junk is basically. After that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth. Little Bits, But a Big Deal shows you that some people might not really care about those tiny forms of debris, but you actually should if they go at a very fast speed."
24101,9,2,1,he organizes the article from history to crashes tothe problems that concern micro debris. and what is being done to stop it.

24103,9,2,2,"The author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about. The next paragraph is 'What is Space Junk' which is telling us what space junk is which is the cause for all the debri and junk in space. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course' which tells us what the space junk has caused in space.  The last section is 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal and it tells how people feel about the junk and what is going to happen to it all."
24104,9,0,0,The author organizes this artical of how these project help the Earth but can also harm the Earth.
24105,9,1,1,Like the way he starts it of gets you in it then he start to describe them in sections and certain parts to make the article good and didn't stick on one sublect but speard it out and also had facts in the article some of the things they do when they are in space and the oblects they use
24106,9,1,1,From talking about what is space junk. Then the author talks about the most serious concepts of what space junk can do to spacecrafts in orbit.
24107,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article with specific titles for each section.  For instance, one of the titles is called, 'Crash Course.'  This section of the article explains how satelites and other debris floating in space can potentially collide and screw up satelites with will affect global communication."

The russians launch a satellite. Then the auther goes into how debris can get into the orbit by telling us that satellites do crash into eachother. Then he goes into how these little peices of deebris are a big deal because they can be caught and pulled down to the earth at enormous speeds.
24113,9,1,1,By putting them in order and using titles of his story to catch yur eye and make u want to read how inportant it is
24114,9,1,2,The author organizes this article by putting headings at the top of the page and keeps adding new ones when he changes subjects. It lets you know the good about space junk and the bad about space junk. Then it goes into the sizes of stuff how even the little pice of sand is a big deal and could really hurt your space craft.
24115,9,2,2,"the author organizes the article into sections that explain what it is, what is couses, and how we are affected. each section is wsell informed and organized. such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled (Crash Course)."
24116,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article with an introduction, and three body paragraphs.      Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing."
24117,9,1,2,This author organizes the article first with an introduction to grab the reader's attention. The introduction introduces us to what the rest of the paper is going to be about. The author then is able to explain exactly what the paper is about with 'What Is Space Junk?' He then gives us an example of what is going on with the problem and then why it is important and what is being done to help it.
24118,9,2,2,"The author starts out the article with an introduction the will grab the readers attention and make them keep reading. He also catorgorises each section with a title like; 'what is space junk','crash course', and 'little bits, but big deal' to let the reader know what each paragraph is about. the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions."
24119,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by, first grabbing the readers attention, then describing what space junk really is, then how space junk is formed, and lastly why we should care about it, and what we can do to reduce space junk."
24120,9,0,0,The author used organized paragraphs
24121,9,1,0,The author organizes the article into groups.
24122,9,1,1,"The author organizes the articles by splitting them up into different sections, and they all have different titles on what the paragraph is about."
24123,9,2,2,The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article. for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk. then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be. At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone. That is how he organizes the article.
24124,9,2,2,"They organize it into subject matter: 'What IS space junk?','Crash Cource', and 'Little Bits, Bit a Big Deal.' They also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections."
24125,9,1,1,"The author organizes this article in a interesting format. For example, he introduces us with dialouge between two people. Then he changes his tone into a serious matter and explains what he is going to talk about.      Also, he divides his paragraphs into topics so we know what the next paragraph is about. This shows that he is very organized and wants to keep us organized as well while we are reading it."
24126,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article about aspects of space exploration in a specific way. The author first gives the reader an attention grabber in the introduction. Then, the author informs the reader about a brief history about space exploration and space 'junk'. From there, the author talks about satellites and how space junk can be harmful to the surface of the earth."
24127,9,1,2,The author organizes the story by first explaining where and when the space junk first started and where it came frm. Then the story later explains how these little problems can became a very serious matter.
24128,9,0,0,grab your telescope! look up in the sky! its a comet!its a meteor!
24129,9,1,1,The author put this articke in different collums and explains what each of the headings mean.
24130,9,2,1,He starts off by giving information on the history of satellites then goes into detail on how satellites can collide with eachother. That is when he then explains why space trash is bad.
24131,9,1,1,"In this article, the author does a great job at organizing all of his information. I think that it was good that the author had a main title and an introduction that explained all that he or she was going to talk about, and then the author had subtitles when they were going on a new topic. I know that when the questions came up, it was very easy for me to find the answers because the subtitles organized it very well."
24132,9,1,1,The author shows good organizational skills with the way he or she wrote the article. He or she started out with suspence then went into some history. Then ended with a warning about the dangers of space junk.
24133,9,2,2,The first part of the artice he uses the word space junk. Then in paragrphs 4 and 5 he explains what it is and how they circle the earth in there own orbit. In paragraphs 6 and 7he talks about what happens if two of the satelites collide together then it forms tiny peice of material that cant be seen from earth. Also in the last paragraph he tells how the tiny peices of debris still plays a big part in space.
24134,9,2,2,"The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force."

These small pieces can cause damage, because of the rate of speed that they are moving."
24245,9,1,1,The author opens this article atracting the reader then the author gives us facts about why sapce junk is a serious matter and its increasing so we should work together to make a solution.
24246,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article in sections. The first paragraph, the introduction, introduces the topic of the article. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?', provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly. The third section, 'Crash Course', shows how the problem began. The forth section, 'Little BIts, But a Big Deal', shows how important the topic really is in regard to the pollution of the Earth."
24247,9,2,2,"The Author organizes the article into three sections. He talks about three very important probles in space. One section talks about and describes what is space junk. For example, it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk. The next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships. The last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal."
24248,9,2,1,First theres an introduction and that gets you to want to read and figure out what the purpose of the story is. Then it explains what space junk is and gives history of how it has been made and some history about satellites. After that it gives and example of a time in which an occurance has happened when two satellites collided. Then the story goes on about what precautions and how dangerous it is when they launch space missions or satellites. I thought it was a good way to organize it all.
24249,9,0,0,The author does a very good job of doing the article. He tells it step by step so people know what he is saying.
24250,9,1,1,The author organizes this article by putting a hook first 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!'  Then he proceeds to tell a breif hisory. Than he moves to talking about the actual topic of space junk.
24251,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other. The introduction serves to catch the reader's attention, 'What is Space Junk' informs the reader about what exactly space junk is, and the final two sections inform us of the author's opinions on space junk."
24252,9,1,1,the aurthor organize the article by putting the information about when we start to first put satillites into space and then starts talking about other things about the satillites and ends it with they hope that the space agencies will come together and clear up space junk.
24253,9,1,1,in Cadigories.
24254,9,1,1,He seperates different tpoics into different paragraphs. In each paragraph he describes the topic and gives examples.
24255,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by breaking it up into smaller bits of information that all have to do with one another subject wise. The sections in the article are arranged in a way that is easy to understand, and gives information so you understand the next article. This is obvious because if the author didnt give you the 'What Is Space junk?' part, you wouldn't understand what space junk is in the next two sections."
24256,9,1,1,In sections to support the authors ideas.
24257,9,0,0,he organize it by putting it in a order where you would understand it better.
24258,9,2,1,"The author organizes the article by providing an example of space junk, why it is occuring, and just how dangerous space junk can be. In the first section, the writer tells about the tool bag, and how orbitals for stalites are cluttered. In the second and third sections, the writer is explaining what space junk is, and how it occurs. In the last section, the writer talk about the problems space junk is posing, and how it is more important than people think. This organization is effective, because the reader wants to continue reading for explanations and examples."
24259,9,1,1,The arthor gives many details why space junk is not good at all. Some people don't care when others do. The author also puts the details in sections and all the information that they are talking about all in one paragraph and they don't skip around. They tell us that some people take it seriously and some people don't play around with things like space junk.
24260,9,1,1,The author puts the information into categories.
24261,9,0,0,he he is careful on how he describes the way space jumk is made.
24262,9,2,2,"The author starts on a somewhat fast pace, trying to grab the reader's attention. It starts with how space junk got there and where it all came from and what they put in space. Then it goes to 'Crash Course', which tells about how all them satellites and other space debris collide at speeds that are very fast. And finally, 'Little Bits' which is about how the little debris can do a lot of damage to orbiting satellites."
24263,9,1,1,He seperates it into different parts.
24264,9,1,1,The author organizes this article by putting the information in different sections. He puts the headings as interesting titles so the reader will be interseted before reading the article. At the begging of the stroy he uses a retorical question to grab your attention.
24265,9,1,1,The author has organize the paper from introduction which hooks people to the story .Then the next paragraph he put the informatiom of the begin of the space and the space junk.
24266,9,1,1,The author organizes the article in a way for you to understand the seriousness of space junk. It starts out funny but then goes into seriousness and then ends with satistics. Overall the author just wants to inform the reader on the seriousness and the dangers of space junk.
24267,9,0,0,aneye catching first line thats works its way into the article while using some unique words to catch your eye
24268,9,2,2,The author starts off by telling us what space junk is. Which is debrie from satelittes and tools. Then he tells us how space junk is created. He tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box. Next the author says that even the smallest bits of the space junk is harmfull and can do serious damage. Finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts.
24269,9,1,1,The author oraganized this article with three different titles that are important about space and what people put out there.
24270,9,2,2,"The author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used. He describes many of the passages by showing what can happen. For example in 'Crash Course' he tells about how satellites can come to collide with each other and cause serious damage and make more space debris. Also in the passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author shows what can happen to an object whenever it gets hit by debris by noting what a sandblaster can do to a concrete wall."
24271,9,1,1,"The auther organizes this pasage vary well in my retrospect. the way he or she is trying to orginize the fallowing artical, is into littel sections of diffrent paraphrase to help the reader orginize the diffrent information in there head. So it makes it well writin."
24272,9,0,0,The article was about how a orbiting junk. they talked about tool bag.Space junk is currently of great
24273,9,0,0,the author organizes this article with the facts first then alll the supporting details then what hes trying to get across witch would be the space junk can be very harmfull to anyone or anything travling through space.
24274,9,2,2,"The author breaks the article into three parts which are, What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. The author does this so he can get the point of each section across in an easier way to understand."
24275,9,2,2,"The author begins with an introduction intended to catch the reader's attention.  He then explores the topic in more detail, using three different sections.  The first one, entitled 'What is Space Junk?' explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth.  The next section, 'Crash Course,' describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide.  Finally, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains why space junk is a problem  and why it is important to find a solution."
24276,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by breaking down the main points into sessions instead of just reading it with no explanation. It starts off with a problem, the problem is explained, the problem happens, then finally it says how the problem can be taken care of.       The introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article. It holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky.      The next two paragraphs explian what space junk is. It tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space. They raise the awarness of what is happening in space and how it could be a problem in the future.      The section titled Crash Cousrse tells us the problem. It says how it is not safe and how an accident happend in space with all the debris flying around.       Finally, the last section tells us how we can care. Clean-up is possible. But, it is still dangerous in space. Many fragments float around that cannot be detected. It also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free.     The article is organized chronoligically. They state, a problem, and throughout the paragraph, they say what happens and how efforts are being amde to make it better."
24277,9,0,1,The author gets us thinking about space and the things that go on. Then gives us the history about the space exploration and the dangers there are in space. The author tells us about all the space junk especially that can be seriously dangerous. All the information lead up to the fact that there is a lot of junk floating around in space thats dangerous and that the satellites could collide because it has happened before.
24278,9,1,1,"He orders the passge by what space junk is, how it gets there, and the problem it is causing."
24279,9,0,1,"This article is based on the organization of things in space such as bad things, good things, and historical things. This article has information about trash in space, collision of satellites, and junk throughout space."
24280,9,1,1,"He puts the article in different sections to organize the main points in each section. For example, space junk can be anything released into space."
24281,9,1,1,"It starts off with startling statements to pull the reader in then goes over a brief history about space junk, then explains how dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other and then talks about the importance of space junk in the paragraph 'Little bits, but a big deal.'"
24282,9,2,2,"'What Is Space Junk?' is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage. it tells us some starter facts and other things.     'Crash Course' explains a couple starter facts that introduce us to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.     'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' kind of wraps up the entire passage and explains into more detail, what space junk really is and the dangers of it.  It explains that it's not going, like, five miles and hour, but THOUSANDS!"
24283,9,0,0,The author organized the article by stating the problem.  Then telling what they are. Gives information about how serious this situation is.
24284,9,2,2,"The author divides the article into 3 sections and an introduction.   Each section has a main focus, but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris.  The introduction is used to draw the reader in with odd statements that one does not usually here.  Then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination.  The following section explains collisions involving space debris.  The last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article."
24285,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by putting the information into catagories. They give a brief summary in the introduction, and go straight into the first section; 'What is Space Junk?' The author explains what space junk is, and how it is formed.      Next, they go into what happens if two space satellites collide with each other, in the 'Crash Course' section of the article. They give examples about this topic.     And finally, they end the article with the 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section. This talks about the seriousness of space junk.     So overall, the author chooses to organize the article by sorting the information into subjects, based on the different topics of space junk. This makes the article very easy to read and to understand."

Then it goes to the next section going into detail in the 'Crash Course' artice where it talkes about how space junk is always colliding and in a crash course. Finially it talks about how the smaller pieces of junk could be the works parts of the Junk in the Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section."
24293,9,2,2,The author organizes the artical by subtitles. some of the subtitles they used are What Is Space Junk? and Crash Course
24294,9,2,2,"The author first introduces the idea of space junk and the government's concern with it. He then writes of how the 'junk' gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue. He tells of the variety as well. Next, he points out the danger of dead satellite collisions ,and again specifies some of the reasons that such debri occur in space. He goes on to make sure that all realize that this is dangerous to themselves so that they do not blatantly disregard the article. He emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space. He also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel. He also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution.

The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous."
24333,9,2,1,"In this article, the author has organized it in a unique way. The author has used the providing information to contrast the harmful dangers of space junk. The article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained. The author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation. With no one to control the dead satellites, they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other.' This can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in February 2009. This impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path."
24334,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion. He starts with the introduction by introducing 'space junk'. Then, he provides the audience with information about what space junk is. The author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space. He finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact."
24335,9,2,2,"The author follows the introduction with background information on the history of space exploration and introduces the urge of different countries to begin researching space. The author than transitions from speaking about satellites that begin orbiting, into the dangers involving collisions between objects in space. To add credibility, a actual account is stated that relates how serious this problem of space junk can be. Finally, the importance of safety is again stressed and it is said that the problem has not yet been solved."
24336,9,1,2,The author organizes the problem by starting at the beggining when we first started exploring space. Then the author goes in order from there and tells us how so much debri gets into the orbit around earth. Then the author tells us how dangerous it is and how we can detect it but there is nothing we can do about it.
24337,9,0,0,"The author organizes this article in a smart, and strategic way. At the beginning he catches the reader's eye by making an exctining sentence, and it goes like this; 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a...' and so forth. That is exciting on my part, and made me want to read this.      After the exctining part, the author got serious about his article, and started to state the dangers about 'Space Junk'."
24338,9,1,1,"The auther organizes this article by order of importance. The auther tells about launching space crafts, then moves into the importance of space junk and how space junk creates crash courses."
24339,9,1,1,The author organizes the artical with a title and subheadings. He uses three subheadings to organize it.
24340,9,1,1,"He organizes it with history, then more current events.What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal"
24341,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article in order of importance. He first introduces the idea of space junk posing a problem, describes how it has occurred, and closes with startling information about how space pollution is a very large threat to space exploration."
24342,9,1,1,He organizes it by putting sections and paragraphs in it. also by naming everything.
24343,9,2,2,The author organizest the article very well. The author uses the introduction to get the point across. He then does a good job in explaining what space junk really is and how it is increasing as we are now doing more and more space research. This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit. The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites. The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem. I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author.
24344,9,2,1,"The author organizes the article by addressing a brief history of space travel and a brief description of what exactly space junk is. Then it gives us some examples of what caused some space junk to accumulate and make microdebris fields. Lastly, they address what they have tried to do to reduce the amount of space junk that is orbitting our planet."
24345,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article by using different sections. The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The cause for this is to have everything more organized."
24346,9,1,1,Her organizes the story by using pargraphs that contain a specific topic. These pargraphs have titles above to give you and idea of the point about to be made.
24347,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article as orbiting junk, explains what space junk is, the crash course, and why little bits are a big deal."
24348,9,0,2,They organize it by the data. In 'What Is Spave Junk' they stick to just describing certain things and then when they wanted to go to a new subject they went into 'Crash Course.' They kept all of the same ideas together instead of running them all together.
24349,9,2,1,"The author organizes this article in sequential order.  The article starts by telling you what 'space junk' is.  Then, the author tells you what affects it has on satellites.  Finally, the author explains how the debris is small and it makes it hard for astronauts to see it.This article is in sequential order because it shows the sequence in which the events happen."
24350,9,0,0,He organizes the article from most dangerous to the solutions or what we are working on to be our solutions.
24351,9,1,1,"The author starts the article with a fun attention getter, and then swtiches to a more serious organized fashion of writing. It is split into 4 detailed topics that explain space junk."
24352,9,2,2,The author organizes this piece very well do to the fact that everything is titled and is in there own little section.  For example when they talk about the debres crashing into things they placed that in the crash course section of the piece.
24353,9,2,2,"In the article 'Orbiting Junk', the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense - He starts out with the introduction, which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention. He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution."
24354,9,2,2,"The author seperates the article into a build up/introduction, and then different potential issues that can arise from space junk.  The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk?'(Build up). And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk."

It's a...tool bag?'.  This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more.  Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.

The author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites.  By making this reference, readers feel more personal to the subject because our generation are so absorbed by communication devices.     The next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk.  It describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles.  The next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes.  Just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles.

24524,9,1,1,He organizes it into different storys with different titles.
24525,9,1,1,"I believe is in chronological order according to years. In the very section after the introduction, it says in 1957. After that it gradually progresses to present day. The author also would explain the major problems in the past, and work his way up to explaining our modern day problems. For example, the author talked about 'Space Junk' in 1957, and later in the article about satellites crashing into one another in 2009."
24526,9,2,2,The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say.  If he didn't conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about Orbiting Junk and Crash Course.  The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections.

After that he explains how serious space junk really is, then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries.     But the last and maybe most important thing, is the microdebris fields, the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball. While people may thing a baseball is small, and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger."
24530,9,2,2,"The author starts out with an introduction paragraph that was written in a way to grab the reader's attention and get them to keep reading. It's written in an almost comical way by using a phrase that many people have heard before, which is the first sentence in reference to the famous 'Superman' line. Then it goes on to paragraph to that is used to explain to the reader just what the rest of the article is going to be about and give a little background information on it. It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed. Then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 6-7 titled,'Crash Course.' It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites. The risks and dangers are further explained in, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage. It concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem."

24533,9,1,1,The author first starts off by telling what the problem is. The problem is space junk. The author explains exactly what this 'junk' is. The author then gives a history of space exploration. I think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up. The important thing is they realize its a problem; that is explained in the last section. They're trying to find ways to solve this problem.
24534,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first. By doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place. After that they tell you about the crash course. In that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another. Then after they tell you about that, they tell you how unsafe little bits are. Within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space."

Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This talks about how little thing that get lost in space like tools from astronauts get lost in space and which can cause a lot of damage."
24537,9,1,2,"The author starts his article with a joke, then it turns to serious. The author moves to the dates to satellite crashes and other dates of space. On the last section the author talks about how space junk is dangerous and why we need to stop sending excess substances into outerspace."
24538,9,2,2,"He organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is, what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way."
24539,9,1,2,"The author begins the article with strange sentences to gain the attention of the reader.  Then the author begins inform the reader of the dangers of debris in space, first by giving a brief history of space exploration.  The article is then divided into sections which talk about different types of debris such as satellites, and small bits of space trash.  In each section the author describes the danger of each.  The article ends by the author describing efforts being made by NASA and the European Space Agency to maintain catalouges of space debris and to help reduce space debris."

Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising."

It starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention. It then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is, as well as the 'great space invasion.' In the third section, it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space. Finally in the last section, it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about. It also presents a solution."
24547,9,1,1,"The author starts out the article with excitement and makes the reader more interested in this passage.  He organized it by starting out with what was seen in the sky that you don't see everyday.  He's got different titles which talk about what exactly is in the sky on this earth that we don't normally see such as space junk and what it is.  He then goes into talk about how the space junk causes crashes and the harm that it has.  Then he goes into talking about how even if it's little particles that aren't very big, can still cause serious damage due to the the speed of the spacecraft and what it runs into."

Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth. In the final section, 'Little Bits, Big Deal', the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed.

24659,9,2,2,"The author organizes the artical from history to present, he/ she lists things for the matters they are in like say crash course they explain that the satilites crash from the course they are on. Then say what is space junk they tell you what space junk is and how it happend way back when. the person lets you know what the sections are about."
24660,9,1,1,The author supports this article by giving a good and stronge reason and in diffrent areas to help and break down the problem in a simple way. Such as puting it in diffrent forms of phragraphs so that the read can better understand what the author is tring to tell the readers reading this. Although it is very long it toke a very complicated matter and put it into a simple form fo readers that are at a young age to fully understane the importance in space junk.
24661,9,1,1,It is organized into sections on the junk in outer space.  They are telling you that it can be a very dangerous matter.  Each section is about different things.  Space trash is still increasing these days.  Without anyone at the controls dead satellites could collide with each other.
24662,9,0,0,"The author does ok. The author's reference to the tool bag in the first paragraph, isn't talked about again untill about two paragraphs later. I, as the reader, had no clue what the author meant by tool bag untill the end of the second topic."
24663,9,2,2,"The author of this article starts with an introduction that states once clear space is 'now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions.' The author then goes on to explain precisely what space junk is and how it has formed in the seciton entitled, 'What IS Space Junk?' The next section, entitled 'Crash Course', goes on to explain the harm that space debris can cause to spacecraft. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' concludes the article by telling why we should care about space debris. The section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris."
24664,9,0,0,"He explains it, when gives examples of things that have gotten lose in space."
24665,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article from most important to the least important.  The author goes form 'What is Space Junk' to 'Crash Course' and finally to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  He goes this way because to understand what the reader is talking about, you must first understand what space junk is, and to understand why is it important, you have to know how dangerous space junk is by knowing that the space junk has crashed into and destroyed many spaceships."

24667,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article in different ways. such as What is Space Junk talks about all of the different things that do get sent out and lost or 'dies'. Crash course talks about how the dead satellites run into eachother.Also Little bits, But its a big deal explains that even though they can be little bitty pieces of the 'space junk' they do matter."
24668,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by talking about the junk that is orbiting space now then explaning space junk to people who dont know what it is, and then after that explaining the harm and or problems that the junk could have on earth and even the people who travel out to space."
24669,9,0,1,"The author organized this article with a attention getter, and than some starlting facts after the fact you have been pulled in. Than the author gives some really startling facts that are really interesting. The author informs you how far away the junk is and how fast it can come back to earth and do some serious damage."
24670,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine. It includes headings with short paragraghes under them. The point of the article is made very clear in a short amount of space with many imperative facts and details. They make it interesting by giving each heading an apealing name such as 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'"
24671,9,1,1,"The author breaks up the artical into three different parts. He does that so that you can understand what the artical is talking about. If he mixed it all into one many people would be very confused. So he simplifies it so that the already hard topic he is bringing forward, is much easier to understand by the people reading the aritical."
24672,9,2,2,"the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article.  The author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit, 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.'  Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged. Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk. 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.'"
24673,9,1,1,he gets the tittle on what he want to wright about then he goes and tittles the story haedings.
24674,9,1,1,"I would say that the author organized this passage in a way of most important and which came first. In the passage 'What Is Space Junk', it talks about how satelites began and the last passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal',"
24675,9,1,1,The author organizes this article great. He drew me in by the introdtuction. The author also had very good detail on space junk and he had had an excellent body. The author really did a great job on organizing his article.
24676,9,0,1,The author organizes this article in a very unique way. In the introduction he grabs your attention by stating  'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' By saying that the author has automatically grabbed your attention and you are now hooked in on reading the article. Then the author writes a series of important facts that can be useful for you to know.
24677,9,0,0,By puting the stories in the right order on how it would happen first.
24678,9,1,0,"He organizes the article with telling us what spacejunk is. what it does, and how its dangerous."
24679,9,0,0,he gives lots of information throughout the article.
24680,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by building up information. He starts off with how it all started by explaining what space junk is. Then he tells us how sattelites will eventually crash into each other. Finally, he axplains how the results of those crashes will create debris that can cause a big problem with the Earth."
24681,9,2,2,"The Author organizes this article in three different sections. They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about, space junk. Then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space. Finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize, it is very effective."
24682,9,1,1,The author organizes this article by events that lead up to what his main topic is. he starts with the first artificial satellite and end with all the space trash in outer space now.
24683,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by first, grabbing our attention in an artful, playful manner (Lines 1-2). The author then goes on to explain how space junk is created, although in a much more serious manner. Once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk', the author goes in-depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments, in the way of collissions, and free-orbiting satellites. Eventually, the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel, and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'."
24684,9,1,1,The author explains a story first for an example then he goes to his point. He tells wat space junk is then he tells why it is harfull even if we think it is not. He does this when he talks about stuff hitting each other in there orbit and when a simple toolbag could cause a problem.
24685,9,0,0,First the author tills you what the article is all about then the author tills you the dangers of it.
24686,9,1,1,"The author starts out interseting.  Then they give us statistics about what has happened in the past years.  Around the sixth paragraph they give us examples.  By the eighth and ninth paragraphs they are talking about the bag, which was mentioned in the introduction.  The conclusion of this passage is saying that they hope to one day come up with a sollution to this."
24687,9,2,2,The just use thing they know and but things where they belong. Like 'What is Space Junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements. They always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under. They never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'What is Space Junk' it just dosent fit. They only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about.
24688,9,1,2,"It begins with a humorous statement meant to entertain the reader and lead him or her inot the next paragraph which tells the reader what the passage is going to be about.

24691,9,1,1,IN SECTIONS SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC ANSWER TO A QUESTION YOU JUST LOOK UNDER THE TOPIC IT MAY BE UNDER.
24692,9,2,2,"The article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite and how the United States followed along behind them. Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause."
24693,9,1,1,He organize it in diffrent topics in the story. Like one topic is 'orbiting junk' and the next one is 'what space is' so he switchis off on diffrent topics. witch i think keeps you more intested in the story cause theres diffrent topics.
24694,9,0,1,by telling what each topic is talking about and how those topics explain all the things about space

24696,9,1,0,He begins with shocking statments to get the reader interested then he begins with the history behind all spacecrafts and how they were created and what purpose they were used for.
24697,9,2,2,"The article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope.  Then it gives a brief history of space exploration, and a couple incidents of space debris; including the 2009 satellite crash and the toolbag.  It then comes out and tells you how big of a problem things from a toolbag to destroyed satellites by telling you about a sandblaster and how it works and using it as a larger scale for objects in orbit."
24698,9,0,0,He tells people how their is junk from the satelites hitting each other and that their is junk every where in the orbits.
24699,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections. The first section is called Orbiting Junk. The second is called What is space junk? The third is called Crash course. The fourth is called Little Bits, but a Big Deal. They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article. So its not all in one combination."
24700,9,0,1,He organizes the article by what happened in the past first and then talks about what is going to happened or what could happen.
24701,9,1,1,The author organized his writing by sectioning his writing off.
24702,9,2,2,"He starts out as, describing space junk. Than he goes to crash course, and tells the reader if something extremely bad happens this is the approch. Than last he talks about space trash. He describes the outter space, with all of the trash floating around in it, from previous astronotes.      He goes into great detail about everything that he talks about, but also its not drawn out to where you fall asleep reading it. The author did a really good job of writing this article."
24703,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by seperating the facts of everything.  The facts that he talked about include, the clutter in space, and when they launched the first artificial satellite and space junk got started, and who is going to take responsibility for the space trash."
24704,9,2,2,"The author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first. Then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created. It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk. The second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur, as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring. The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships, and how ships cannot avoid it easily. The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk."
24705,9,2,2,"The first paragraph is to get the readers attention, and make them want to read the story. Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' and because more serious. This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it.     The next section is called 'Crash Course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide, and it gives example of this happening in February 2009 with two communication satellites.     Section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section, and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter. The section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts, and our space crafts that we send into space. The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing, and is still a problem. All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem."
24706,9,0,0,"The author organizes the article by the development of space technology and the dates in which the statistics of space junk; staelites, telescopes and ect, are reconized."
24707,9,1,1,"The author uses titles before it opens up new information. For example one of the titles is Orbiting Junk, after that the author explains with information."
24708,9,1,1,"The author first used a hook to catch the reader's attention by using a question. Then he explained what space junk was, how satellites can crash into each other, how space debris is a big deal, how space debris is harmful, and how they are trying to come up with a solution for it."
24709,9,1,1,The author organizes the article by giving you information about the junk and a time when an actual space invasion occured. Then the article goes into how people might think its not a big deal but it is.
24710,9,2,2,"The author organized the article by separating information into several different sections. First, he/she explained what space debris is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. Secondly, he/she used an example of the negative effects that space debris has caused to space in ' Crash Course'.Then finally, they use information from space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on Earth in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'."
24711,9,0,0,IT WAS NOT ORGANIZED WELL
24712,9,1,0,My opinion of this article is that it is well organized and well written. Why I say that is because it grabbed my atttention expecially in the introduction. As I followed along and continued to read the facts and concerns of this article made me want to read it.
24713,9,1,1,The author oraginizes the article in varies ways. He first gets our attention by using questions and loud statements to get our attnetion. Then he shows us the harm in space junk and gives us facts about the way we are taking care of the atmosphere. THen he leads us to the end where he tells us what we can do to avooid harmful situations and gives us tips on how to improve our wasteful tendencies.
24714,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article by first informing the reader about the topic of space junk. History is used to give an accurate example of space junk. After some background information is given, the author uses statistics and facts to show the reader how dangerous space junk can be. Lastly, the author ties up the last paragraph emphasizing the damage space junk can do and what a threat it can be in the future. The author end the article with a concerned tone and uses the organization of the article to fully inform the reader."
24715,9,2,2,"The other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention. Then is gives a brief history entitled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that secton it moves onto  a more recent accident with space junk, and finishes the article off with the dangers of the little debri."
24716,9,2,2,"The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes his article into several subtopics so that the reader can clearly see the change of subjects in the article making it easier to read. The subtopic 'What Is Space Junk' talks about and defines what space junk really is, while 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' talks about the relavence of space junk and its effect on space travel."
24717,9,1,1,He grabs your attention with a little action. Then he explains what space junk is and it can damage space things. How little things make a big deal.
24718,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily, without much confusion. Before he/she goes on to inform you about the trouble space junk is causing, they inform you what space junk is. Then they inform you of some of the things that are happening because of space junk, as in satellites crashing together. And they conclude by telling how big of a problem space junk has been and will be, because 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing.'"
24719,9,1,1,The author organizes it into different subsections based of what the subject of the section is
24720,9,2,2,"First, the author talks about Space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched. Then, the author talks about how this ''space junk'' is currently of great concern to the government agencies."
24721,9,1,1,"The author puts this article in a weird way, He or she starts by a eye catching introduction and then goes to a boring history lesson about satelittes and space junk. Then the author takes us into another exciting paragraph about satelittes crashing into each other and it just goes on and on until the article is over but somehow at the end of it all i still wanted to know more."
24722,9,2,1,"At first the author uses a suprising statement to grab the readers attention, and bring them into the article itself.     Next the author discusses the seriousness of space junk circling our planet.     The author than defines what space junk is, and than gives a brief history on where space junk came from.      The author than talks about the dangers of space junk colliding with other objects such as functional sattalites and human being who are workign outside of their spacecraft.     Finally the author talks about how dangerous even the smallest pieces of space debris can be extremely harmful, and how scientists and entire nation are working together to solve the problem of 'Space Junk'."
24723,9,1,1,The author organizes the article but making side headings of the more important things about space and space junk and orginizing information to go into those areas.
24724,9,2,2,"The organization of the article is information in each section, while collectively, the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk.' The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful. The organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear, yet non-descript situational plot."
24725,9,1,0,the author organizes the artical but putting stictics in first before try to persuade the readres what really happen i think it is really good becuase people need to know the true facts.
24726,9,2,2,The author seperates the article into different sections that have information that goes along with cooresponding information in each of the sections. For example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009. In the section it first tells the reader what could possibly happen and then gives an example or a possible scenario.In another example the author titles a section 'What Is Space Junk?' The author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside Earth's atmosphere. Then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk' are found in space from these previous space missions.
24727,9,1,1,"The author organized this to where he could draw attention to the passage. Starting with the rehtorical questions, then describing space junk. Telling the reader how it got there, and what peoples reaction is to the space junk."
24728,9,2,2,"The author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'Orbiting Junk' that is used to introduce the subject. The author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger. He then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful."
24729,9,2,2,"The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it. 'What is Space Junk?' describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space. 'Crash Course' tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the Earth's orbit. It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris, it's ANY object. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' tell about how much people truly care about what's going on in space. It also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided."
24730,9,1,0,The author begins the article with fun interesting words that grab the reader and then he jumps into the seriuous matter of the story.
24731,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article in a way were the reader first recieves information on what space junk really is, then the harmful consequences Earth could face when two satellites do collide."
24732,9,1,1,The author organizes the article by putting the same subjects together into paragraphs and different topics in different paragraphs.
24733,9,0,0,FROM FUN NEWS TO REALLY BAD INFORMATION ABOUT TODAY OUTTER SPACE
24734,9,2,2,"The author starts off the passage with a comical line, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?' From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space."
24735,9,1,0,"He first explains what is beyond the Earth's atmospere and how it got there, then explains that the things that are beyond the Earth's atmospere do break and become an issue, after that he explains how they have a big effect on things."
24736,9,1,1,"He organizes it by getting the readers attention by starting it with a shocking sentence, then he casually starts explaining how dangerous space junk really is."
24737,9,2,2,"The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article. They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader's attention, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!', then move into describing the topic of their article, space junk, more clearly, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk...' The following paragraphs explain how space junk comes to be, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other', and the article closes with the dangers of space junk, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.'"
24738,9,2,2,"The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article into four sections.  The introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern.  The author goes on to explain what space junk is and transitions into why it is a problem in the next two paragraphs.  Finally, the author wants to raise awareness that the volume of space trash is in fact increasing and that it is difficult to avoid."
24739,9,1,1,They organize it by using ancadotes as the introductions then breaking down the article into sections that discuss the different topics.
24740,9,0,0,to make it sound like its a big deal that space junk is a big problem so he gets peoples attention.
24741,9,0,0,The author organizes the article by lining up the statistics well and providing alot of useful information in the article. The reader is very educated by the end of the article.

24743,9,2,1,"The author seperates the article into different parts. There are four main parts. There are three main parts each with a different topic on space junk.     In the first the author uses a humerous appraoch like, 'It's a... tool bag?' but then moves to a more serious tone. The author explains that it is a serious issue.     the author presents the dangers and problems in the later sections. Finally, at the end he says how many nations contribute to the problem and it must be solved. So first he gets your attention, then the next section explains what it is, and the last two present the issues and the seriousness of it while concluding the paper."
24744,9,0,0,"By giving insight on the problem, then giving solutions."
24745,9,1,1,He talks about the history of Space and how we have satellites. Then talks about the importance of saellite debris and how it can be very dangerous.
24746,9,0,0,"The author starts out gentle and says the facts straight out. The author starts to get very harsh and starts to state that this is a serious matter. The organization of this artical not only helps keep a eye on it, but it helps to tell us about this and what will happen to stuff in the atmosphere. From going to gentle and easing us into the more painful facts was a great way to write this artical."
24747,9,1,1,He starts of with a attention getter and goes into the seriousness of the essay. then he explains how thesse things happen and shows just because they are small doesnt mean they are not effective.
24748,9,0,0,He puts it impportanc.
24749,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article into several sections: the intro, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The first section defines 'space junk' for the reader. Section two explains how debris can be formed by colliding satellites, and section three explains why space junk is a problem."
